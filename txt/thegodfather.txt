
I believe in America.


America has made my fortune.


And I raised my daughter
in the American fashion.


I gave her freedom, but I taught her
never to dishonor her family.

She found a boyfriend, not an Italian.


She went to the movies with him.
She stayed out late.

I didn't protest.


Two months ago he took her for a drive
with another boyfriend.


They made her drink whiskey


and then they tried to
take advantage of her.

She resisted, she kept her honor.


So they beat her like an animal.


When I went to the hospital,
her nose was broken,


her jaw was shattered,
held together by wire.


She couldn't even weep
because of the pain.


But I wept. Why did I weep?


She was the light of my life.


Beautiful girl.


Now she will never be beautiful again.


Sorry.


I went to the police,
like a good American.


These two boys were brought to trial.


The judge sentenced them
to three years in prison,


but suspended the sentence.


Suspended the sentence!
They went free that very day!


I stood in the courtroom like a fool.


Those two bastards, they smiled at me.


Then I said to my wife, "For justice,
we must go to Don Corleone."


Why did you go to the police?
Why didn't you come to me first?


What do you want of me? Tell me
anything, but do what I beg you to do.


What is that?


I want them dead.


That I cannot do.


I'll give you anything you ask.


I've known you many years, but this
is the first time you've asked for help.


I can't remember the last time
you invited me for a cup of coffee.


Even though my wife is godmother
to your only child.


But let's be frank here.
You never wanted my friendship.


And you were afraid to be in my debt.


I didn't want to get into trouble.


I understand.


You found Paradise in America.


You made a good living, had police
protection and there were courts of law.


You didn't need a friend like me.


But now you come to me and say,


"Don Corleone, give me justice."

But you don't ask with respect.


You don't offer friendship. You don't
even think to call me Godfather.


You come on my daughter's wedding
day and ask me to murder for money.


I ask you for justice.


That is not justice.
Your daughter is alive.


Let them suffer, then, as she suffers.


How much shall I pay you?


Bonasera, Bonasera.

What have I ever done to make you
treat me so disrespectfully?


If you'd come in friendship,


the scum that ruined your daughter
would be suffering this very day.


And if an honest man like you should
make enemies, they'd be my enemies.


And then they would fear you.


Be my friend?

61
00:06:43,439 --> 00:06:44,980
Godfather?


Good.


Some day, and that day may never
come, I'll ask a service of you.


But until that day


accept this justice as a gift
on my daughter's wedding day.


- GrÃ¡zie, Godfather.
- Prego.


Give this to Clemenza.


I want people that aren't going to
get carried away.


We're not murderers,
in spite of what this undertaker says.


- Where's Michael?
- Don't worry, he'll be here.


We're not taking the picture
without Michael.


- What's the matter?
- It's Michael.


Don Barzini.


Hey, Paulie! Let me have some wine.


Paulie! More wine.


- You look terrific on the floor.
- Are you a dance judge or something?


Take a walk and do your job.


Sandra, watch the kids.
Don't let them run wild.


You watch yourself, all right?


20, 30 grand. In small bills, cash.


In that little silk purse.


If this were somebody else's wedding...
Sfortunato!


Hey, Paulie!


I got two gabagool, capocol,
and a prosciut.


Stupid jerk!


What's the matter?

87
00:10:49,809 --> 00:10:52,399
- Have to go back to work.
- Tom.

88
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,730
No Sicilian can refuse any request
on his daughter's wedding day.

89
00:11:02,450 --> 00:11:07,580
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me.

90
00:11:12,419 --> 00:11:15,629
Get out of here!
It's a private party. Go on!

91
00:11:16,710 --> 00:11:19,669
What is it? It's my sister's wedding.

92
00:11:26,259 --> 00:11:28,970
Goddamn FBI don't respect nothing!

93
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:35,360
Come here, come here, come here!

94
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:54,169
...but towards the end, he was paroled
to help with the American war effort,

95
00:11:54,250 --> 00:11:57,340
so for six months
he's worked in my pastry shop.

96
00:11:57,419 --> 00:12:00,169
Nazorine, what can I do for you?

97
00:12:00,259 --> 00:12:02,220
Now that the war is over,

98
00:12:02,299 --> 00:12:06,299
this boy, Enzo, they want to
repatriate him back to Italy.

99
00:12:06,389 --> 00:12:11,269
Godfather, I have a daughter.
You see, she and Enzo...

100
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:16,980
You want Enzo to stay in this country,
and your daughter to be married.

101
00:12:18,149 --> 00:12:20,440
You understand everything.

102
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:23,649
Mr. Hagen. Thank you.

103
00:12:26,779 --> 00:12:30,750
Wait till you see the wedding cake
I made for your daughter!

104
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:33,580
The bride, the groom and the angel...

105
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,379
- Who should I give this job to?
- Not to our paisan.

106
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:48,600
Give it to a Jew Congressman in
another district. Who else is on the list?

107
00:12:55,639 --> 00:12:57,230
Hey, Michael!

108
00:13:17,039 --> 00:13:20,500
He's not on the list,
but Luca Brasi wants to see you.

109
00:13:26,340 --> 00:13:28,720
Is this necessary?

110
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:33,429
He didn't expect to be invited to the
wedding, so he wanted to thank you.

111
00:13:34,769 --> 00:13:40,190
Don Corleone, I'm honored and
grateful that you have invited me

112
00:13:40,269 --> 00:13:43,110
on the wedding day of your daughter.

113
00:13:43,190 --> 00:13:45,610
May their first child
be a masculine child.

114
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,240
Michael...

115
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:53,409
That man over there
is talking to himself.

116
00:13:53,490 --> 00:13:56,330
See that scary guy over there?

117
00:13:56,409 --> 00:13:59,919
- He's a very scary guy.
- What's his name?

118
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:04,669
His name is Luca Brasi.
He helps my father out sometimes.

119
00:14:06,470 --> 00:14:09,389
Michael, he's coming over here!

120
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,559
You look terrific!

121
00:14:15,639 --> 00:14:18,940
My brother Tom Hagen,
Miss Kay Adams.

122
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:22,940
Your father's been asking for you.

123
00:14:23,019 --> 00:14:25,860
- Very nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

124
00:14:27,610 --> 00:14:30,320
Why does your brother
have a different name?

125
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:34,289
My brother Sonny found Tom Hagen
in the street.

126
00:14:34,370 --> 00:14:38,289
He had no home,
so my father took him in.

127
00:14:40,039 --> 00:14:43,129
He's been with us ever since.

128
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:45,169
He's a good lawyer.

129
00:14:46,009 --> 00:14:50,590
Not a Sicilian. I think
he's going to be consigliere.

130
00:14:50,679 --> 00:14:53,600
- What's that?
- That's a,

131
00:14:53,679 --> 00:14:57,470
like a counselor, an advisor.
Very important for the family.

132
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,639
You like your lasagna?

133
00:15:04,899 --> 00:15:07,110
Don Corleone.

134
00:15:07,190 --> 00:15:09,860
I'm honored and grateful

135
00:15:09,950 --> 00:15:13,779
that you have invited me
to your daughter's wedding.

136
00:15:18,789 --> 00:15:22,080
On the day of your daughter's wedding.

137
00:15:22,169 --> 00:15:27,000
And I hope that their first child
will be a masculine child.

138
00:15:28,419 --> 00:15:33,549
I pledge my ever-ending loyalty.

139
00:15:35,509 --> 00:15:40,940
- For your daughter's bridal purse.
- Thank you, Luca. Most valued friend.

140
00:15:41,019 --> 00:15:46,149
Don Corleone, I'm going to leave you
now, because I know you're busy.

141
00:15:46,690 --> 00:15:48,029
Thank you.

142
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:39,870
Signora Corleone!

143
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,909
No!

144
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:58,109
Senator Cauley apologized for not
coming, but said you'd understand.

145
00:17:58,200 --> 00:18:02,450
Also some of the judges.
They've all sent gifts.

146
00:18:05,500 --> 00:18:06,710
What is that outside?

147
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:20,339
Johnny! Johnny!

148
00:18:21,390 --> 00:18:23,059
I love you!

149
00:18:33,359 --> 00:18:36,779
He came all the way from California.
I told you he'd come!

150
00:18:36,859 --> 00:18:40,359
- He's probably in trouble again.
- He's a good godson.

151
00:18:41,369 --> 00:18:45,700
Johnny, Johnny! Sing a song!

152
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:04,140
You never said
you knew Johnny Fontane!

153
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:08,309
- Sure. You want to meet him?
- Great! Sure.

154
00:19:08,390 --> 00:19:12,230
- My father helped him with his career.
- He did?

155
00:19:12,309 --> 00:19:13,400
How?

156
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:18,779
- Let's listen to this song.
- Michael...

157
00:19:52,099 --> 00:19:54,269
Please, Michael. Tell me.

158
00:19:57,769 --> 00:20:02,819
When Johnny was starting out, he was
signed to a personal service contract

159
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:05,779
with a big bandleader.

160
00:20:05,910 --> 00:20:10,119
And as his career got better and better,
he wanted to get out of it.

161
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:13,869
Johnny is my father's godson.

162
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:17,289
My father went to see this bandleader.

163
00:20:17,380 --> 00:20:21,259
He offered him $ 10,000
to let Johnny go,

164
00:20:21,339 --> 00:20:24,089
but the bandleader said no.

165
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:29,559
So the next day my father went to see
him, but this time with Luca Brasi.

166
00:20:31,309 --> 00:20:33,559
Within an hour,

167
00:20:33,640 --> 00:20:39,150
he signed a release
for a certified check of $ 1,000.

168
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:45,109
- How did he do that?
- Made him an offer he couldn't refuse.

169
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:51,660
- What was that?
- Luca Brasi held a gun to his head,

170
00:20:51,789 --> 00:20:57,000
and father said that either his brains or
his signature would be on the contract.

171
00:21:02,009 --> 00:21:03,630
That's a true story.

172
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:17,730
That's my family, Kay. It's not me.

173
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:31,990
Beautiful!

174
00:22:04,230 --> 00:22:06,359
I'll take care of it.

175
00:22:06,450 --> 00:22:08,319
Tom...

176
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:12,119
I want you to find Santino.
Tell him to come to the office.

177
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:22,339
How are you, Fredo?

178
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:25,009
My brother Fredo, this is Kay Adams.

179
00:22:26,089 --> 00:22:28,380
- Hi.
- How are you doing?

180
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:34,849
- This is my brother Mike.
- Are you having a good time?

181
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:37,519
Yeah. This is your friend?

182
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:42,269
I don't know what to do.
My voice is weak. It's weak.

183
00:22:43,980 --> 00:22:50,450
Anyway, if I had this part in the picture,
it puts me right back on top again.

184
00:22:50,529 --> 00:22:55,869
But this...man won't give it to me,
the head of the studio.

185
00:22:55,950 --> 00:22:59,210
- What's his name?
- Woltz.

186
00:22:59,289 --> 00:23:03,460
He won't give it to me,
and he says there's no chance.

187
00:23:07,710 --> 00:23:09,009
Sonny?

188
00:23:10,630 --> 00:23:11,799
Sonny?

189
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,480
Sonny?

190
00:23:20,309 --> 00:23:23,059
- Sonny, are you in there?
- What?

191
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,019
The old man wants you.

192
00:23:26,269 --> 00:23:27,980
One minute.

193
00:23:42,420 --> 00:23:47,460
A month ago he bought the movie rights
to this book, a best-seller.

194
00:23:47,549 --> 00:23:51,130
The main character
is a guy just like me.

195
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:53,890
I wouldn't even have to act.

196
00:23:54,849 --> 00:23:57,680
Godfather, I don't know what to do.

197
00:23:58,970 --> 00:24:03,269
You can act like a man!
What's the matter with you?

198
00:24:03,349 --> 00:24:09,069
Is this how you turned out? A Hollywood
finocchio that cries like a woman?

199
00:24:09,150 --> 00:24:13,200
"What can I do? What can I do?"
What is that nonsense?

200
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:14,990
Ridiculous.

201
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:22,829
- You spend time with your family?
- Sure I do.

202
00:24:22,910 --> 00:24:24,539
Good.

203
00:24:24,579 --> 00:24:29,299
Because a man who doesn't spend time
with his family can never be a real man.

204
00:24:34,930 --> 00:24:38,390
You look terrible. I want you to eat.

205
00:24:38,470 --> 00:24:43,769
Rest, and in a month this Hollywood
big shot will give you what you want.

206
00:24:43,849 --> 00:24:46,980
It's too late,
they start shooting in a week.

207
00:24:47,059 --> 00:24:50,230
I'm going to make him an offer
he can't refuse.

208
00:24:53,069 --> 00:24:58,069
Just go outside and enjoy yourself,
and forget about all this nonsense.

209
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:03,289
- I want you to leave it all to me.
- All right.

210
00:25:28,359 --> 00:25:33,650
- What time does my daughter leave?
- Soon, after they cut the cake.

211
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:37,359
Do we give your son-in-law
something important?

212
00:25:37,450 --> 00:25:42,789
Never. Give him a living, but never
discuss the family business with him.

213
00:25:42,869 --> 00:25:45,660
- What else?
- Virgil Sollozzo called.

214
00:25:45,789 --> 00:25:50,210
- We'll have to see him next week.
- When you come back from California.

215
00:25:51,589 --> 00:25:54,710
- When am I going to California?
- Tonight.

216
00:25:54,839 --> 00:26:00,140
I want you to talk to this movie big shot
and settle this business for Johnny.

217
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:05,599
If there's nothing else, I'd like to go
to my daughter's wedding.

218
00:26:07,769 --> 00:26:10,730
Carlo, we're going to take the picture.

219
00:26:11,769 --> 00:26:13,569
Wait a minute.

220
00:26:13,650 --> 00:26:15,940
No, Michael. Not me.

221
00:26:20,450 --> 00:26:23,329
Okay, that's it. Just like that. Hold it!

222
00:28:13,480 --> 00:28:16,650
- You need a little more heat on that arc.
- Start talking.

223
00:28:16,730 --> 00:28:20,150
I was sent by a friend
of Johnny Fontane.

224
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,990
This friend would give
his friendship to Mr. Woltz,

225
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,910
if Mr. Woltz would grant us a favor.

226
00:28:26,990 --> 00:28:29,329
Woltz is listening.

227
00:28:29,410 --> 00:28:33,500
Give Johnny the part in that war film
you're starting next week.

228
00:28:39,210 --> 00:28:44,220
And what favor would your friend
grant Mr. Woltz?

229
00:28:44,299 --> 00:28:47,849
He could make your future union
problems disappear.

230
00:28:47,930 --> 00:28:52,019
And one of your stars has just moved
from marijuana to heroin.

231
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:56,400
Are you trying to muscle me?
Listen, you son-of-a-bitch!

232
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,069
Let me lay it on the line.

233
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,150
Johnny Fontane
will never get that movie!

234
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:05,779
No matter how many Dago Guinea
greaseballs come out of the woodwork!

235
00:29:05,859 --> 00:29:09,700
- I'm German- Irish.
- Listen here, my Kraut- Mick friend.

236
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:14,160
- I'm going to make trouble for you!
- I'm a lawyer. I haven't threatened...

237
00:29:14,250 --> 00:29:17,630
I know New York's big lawyers.
Who are you?

238
00:29:17,710 --> 00:29:21,250
I have a special practice.
I handle one client.

239
00:29:21,339 --> 00:29:23,339
I'll wait for your call.

240
00:29:25,089 --> 00:29:28,049
By the way,
I admire your pictures very much.

241
00:29:32,849 --> 00:29:34,349
Check him out.

242
00:29:56,869 --> 00:29:59,420
- It's really beautiful.
- Look at this.

243
00:29:59,500 --> 00:30:04,009
- It used to decorate a king's palace.
- Very nice.

244
00:30:04,089 --> 00:30:06,470
Why didn't you say
you work for Corleone?

245
00:30:06,589 --> 00:30:10,799
I thought you were some cheap hustler
Johnny was running in.

246
00:30:10,890 --> 00:30:14,220
- I only use his name when necessary.
- How's your drink?

247
00:30:14,349 --> 00:30:17,809
- Fine.
- Now I'll show you something beautiful.

248
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:20,480
You do appreciate beauty, don't you?

249
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:26,490
There you are. $600,000 on four hoofs.

250
00:30:26,569 --> 00:30:30,529
I bet Russian czars never paid
that for a single horse.

251
00:30:30,619 --> 00:30:32,160
Khartoum.

252
00:30:32,779 --> 00:30:34,079
Khartoum.

253
00:30:35,619 --> 00:30:40,000
I'm not going to race him, though.
I'm going to put him out to stud.

254
00:30:41,579 --> 00:30:43,130
Thanks, Tony.

255
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,839
Let's get something to eat.

256
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:50,339
Corleone is Johnny's godfather.

257
00:30:50,430 --> 00:30:54,849
To the Italian people that's
a very sacred, close relationship.

258
00:30:54,930 --> 00:30:58,849
I respect it.
Tell him to ask me anything else.

259
00:30:58,940 --> 00:31:01,269
This favor I can't give him.

260
00:31:01,349 --> 00:31:04,650
He never asks a second favor
when he's been refused the first.

261
00:31:04,769 --> 00:31:10,910
You don't understand.
Johnny Fontane never gets that movie.

262
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:14,660
That part is perfect for him.
It'll make him a big star.

263
00:31:14,779 --> 00:31:18,869
I'm going to run him out of the business,
and let me tell you why.

264
00:31:20,869 --> 00:31:25,549
Johnny Fontane ruined one of Woltz
International's most valuable protĞÂ©gĞÂ©s.

265
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:31,009
We trained her for five years.
Singing, acting, dancing lessons.

266
00:31:31,130 --> 00:31:35,720
I spent hundreds of thousands of dollars
on her, to make her a big star.

267
00:31:35,809 --> 00:31:38,599
Let me be even more frank.

268
00:31:38,680 --> 00:31:43,690
To show you that I'm not a hard-hearted
man. That it's not all dollars and cents.

269
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:47,400
She was beautiful.
She was young and innocent!

270
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:52,910
She's the greatest piece of ass I've had
and I've had them all over the world.

271
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:59,119
Then Johnny Fontane comes along with
his olive oil voice and Guinea charm.

272
00:31:59,200 --> 00:32:00,910
And she runs off.

273
00:32:02,250 --> 00:32:06,339
She threw it all away
just to make me look ridiculous!

274
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:11,589
And a man in my position can't afford
to be made to look ridiculous!

275
00:32:11,670 --> 00:32:14,009
You get the hell out of here!

276
00:32:14,089 --> 00:32:18,470
If that goombah tries any rough stuff,
tell him I'm no bandleader.

277
00:32:19,769 --> 00:32:22,769
Yeah, I heard that story.

278
00:32:23,599 --> 00:32:27,609
Thank you for dinner
and a very pleasant evening.

279
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:30,569
Maybe your car can take me
to the airport.

280
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:34,240
Mr. Corleone insists on hearing
bad news immediately.

281
00:34:26,929 --> 00:34:30,860
- You're not too tired, are you, Tom?
- No, I slept on the plane.

282
00:34:30,940 --> 00:34:34,030
I have the Sollozzo notes here.

283
00:34:34,110 --> 00:34:35,360
Now...

284
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,909
Sollozzo is known as The Turk.

285
00:34:40,989 --> 00:34:42,949
He's supposed to be very good
with a knife,

286
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:47,460
but only in matters of business
with reasonable complaint.

287
00:34:47,539 --> 00:34:50,789
His business is narcotics.

288
00:34:50,880 --> 00:34:54,250
He has fields in Turkey,
where they grow poppy.

289
00:34:54,340 --> 00:34:58,170
In Sicily he has plants
to process them into heroin.

290
00:34:58,260 --> 00:35:01,760
He needs cash,
he needs protection from the police.

291
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:05,769
He'll give a piece of the action.
I don't know how much.

292
00:35:05,889 --> 00:35:11,099
The Tattaglia family is behind him here.
They have to be in it for something.

293
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,980
- What about his prison record?
- One term in Italy, one here.

294
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:19,820
He's known as a top narcotics man.

295
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:24,579
- Santino, what do you think?
- A lot of money in that white powder.

296
00:35:26,909 --> 00:35:28,289
Tom?

297
00:35:28,369 --> 00:35:32,539
Yes. There's more money in narcotics
than anything else.

298
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:37,380
If we don't get into it, somebody else
will, maybe the five families.

299
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:41,929
With that money they can buy
more police and political power.

300
00:35:42,010 --> 00:35:44,099
Then they come after us.

301
00:35:44,219 --> 00:35:50,730
Now we have unions and gambling, and
that's great, but narcotics is the future.

302
00:35:50,809 --> 00:35:55,940
If we don't get a piece of that action,
we risk everything in 10 years' time.

303
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:03,570
So? What's your answer
going to be, Pop?

304
00:36:08,329 --> 00:36:10,079
Don Corleone.

305
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,460
I need a man who has powerful friends.

306
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:18,300
I need a million dollars in cash.

307
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:24,219
I need those politicians that you carry
in your pocket, like nickels and dimes.

308
00:36:25,679 --> 00:36:29,679
- What is the interest for my family?
-30%.

309
00:36:29,769 --> 00:36:33,730
In the first year your end should be
three, four million dollars.

310
00:36:33,809 --> 00:36:35,809
And then it would go up.

311
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:40,440
And what is the interest
for the Tattaglia family?

312
00:36:42,449 --> 00:36:44,280
My compliments.

313
00:36:47,949 --> 00:36:51,369
I'll take care of them, out of my share.

314
00:36:51,449 --> 00:36:55,750
So I receive 30% for finance,

315
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:59,170
political influence and legal protection?

316
00:36:59,250 --> 00:37:00,960
That's right.

317
00:37:02,260 --> 00:37:06,179
Why do you come to me?
Why do I deserve this generosity?

318
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:11,559
If you consider a million dollars in cash
just finance,

319
00:37:11,639 --> 00:37:13,809
te salud Don Corleone.

320
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:29,579
I said that I would see you, because
I heard you were a serious man,

321
00:37:29,659 --> 00:37:31,909
to be treated with respect.

322
00:37:36,579 --> 00:37:39,880
But, I must say no to you.

323
00:37:41,050 --> 00:37:43,880
And I'll give you my reason.

324
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:46,800
It's true,
I have a lot of friends in politics.

325
00:37:48,050 --> 00:37:52,469
They wouldn't be friendly long if I was
involved in drugs instead of gambling,

326
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:58,190
which they regard as a harmless vice,
but drugs is a dirty business.

327
00:37:58,269 --> 00:38:03,280
It doesn't make any difference to me
what a man does for a living.

328
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:08,610
But your business is...a little dangerous.

329
00:38:08,699 --> 00:38:13,119
If you're worried about security,
the Tattaglias will guarantee it.

330
00:38:13,199 --> 00:38:16,710
- The Tattaglias would guarantee our...
- Wait a minute.

331
00:38:24,010 --> 00:38:28,800
I have a sentimental weakness
for my children, and I spoil them.

332
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:32,139
They talk when they should listen.
But anyway...

333
00:38:32,260 --> 00:38:37,639
Signor Sollozzo, my no is final. I wish to
congratulate you on your new business.

334
00:38:37,730 --> 00:38:41,190
I know you'll do well, and good luck.

335
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:46,110
Especially since your interests
don't conflict with mine. Thank you.

336
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:08,670
Santino.

337
00:39:08,760 --> 00:39:10,590
Come here.

338
00:39:12,929 --> 00:39:14,849
What's the matter with you?

339
00:39:14,929 --> 00:39:19,559
Your brain is going soft
from playing with that girl.

340
00:39:19,639 --> 00:39:23,769
Never tell anybody outside the family
what you're thinking again.

341
00:39:25,070 --> 00:39:26,320
Go on.

342
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:33,119
Tom, what's this nonsense?

343
00:39:33,199 --> 00:39:36,619
It's from Johnny.
He's starring in that new film.

344
00:39:38,949 --> 00:39:41,539
- Take it away.
- Take it over there.

345
00:39:42,829 --> 00:39:44,380
And

346
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:47,590
tell Luca Brasi to come in.

347
00:39:53,719 --> 00:39:57,139
I'm a little worried
about this Sollozzo fellow.

348
00:39:57,219 --> 00:40:00,179
Find out what he's got
under his fingernails.

349
00:40:01,190 --> 00:40:04,809
Go to the Tattaglias.

350
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:09,190
Make them think that you're not
too happy with our family

351
00:40:10,570 --> 00:40:12,949
and find out what you can.

352
00:40:30,420 --> 00:40:33,719
I got something for your mother
and for Sonny

353
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:38,469
and a tie for Freddy,
and Tom Hagen got the Reynolds pen.

354
00:40:38,559 --> 00:40:41,809
- What do you want for Christmas?
- Just you.

355
00:41:13,719 --> 00:41:15,630
Andiamo, Fredo.

356
00:41:15,719 --> 00:41:19,139
- Tell Paulie to get the car.
- Okay, Pop.

357
00:41:19,219 --> 00:41:23,230
I'll have to get it myself.
Paulie called in sick this morning.

358
00:41:24,980 --> 00:41:28,230
Paulie's a good kid.
I don't mind getting the car.

359
00:41:31,650 --> 00:41:33,820
Buon natale, Caro. GrÃ¡zie.

360
00:42:16,449 --> 00:42:20,739
- Luca! I'm Bruno Tattaglia.
- I know.

361
00:42:30,670 --> 00:42:31,670
You know who I am?

362
00:42:31,750 --> 00:42:33,090
I know you.

363
00:42:34,380 --> 00:42:37,969
You have been talking to the
Tattaglia family...right?

364
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:42,969
I think you and I can do business.

365
00:42:44,809 --> 00:42:47,480
I need someone strong like you.

366
00:42:48,099 --> 00:42:50,940
I heard you are not happy...

367
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,650
...with the Corleone family.

368
00:42:54,400 --> 00:42:56,150
Want to join me?

369
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:59,280
What's in it for me?

370
00:43:01,909 --> 00:43:04,829
$50,000 to start with.

371
00:43:06,829 --> 00:43:08,079
Not bad!

372
00:43:09,750 --> 00:43:11,380
Agreed?

373
00:44:10,809 --> 00:44:14,519
Tom! Tom Hagen. Merry Christmas.

374
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:19,570
-Glad to see you. I want to talk to you.
- I haven't got time.

375
00:44:19,650 --> 00:44:22,699
Make time, Consigliere. Get in the car.

376
00:44:24,530 --> 00:44:29,039
What are you worried about? If I wanted
to kill you, you'd be dead already.

377
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:30,579
Get in.

378
00:44:41,590 --> 00:44:45,300
-Fredo, I'm going to buy some fruit.
- Okay, Pop.

379
00:44:52,099 --> 00:44:54,940
Merry Christmas. I want some fruit.

380
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:26,530
Would you like me better
if I were a nun? Like in the story.

381
00:46:29,659 --> 00:46:30,659
No.

382
00:46:30,739 --> 00:46:35,119
- What if I were Ingrid Bergman?
- Now, that's a thought.

383
00:46:37,710 --> 00:46:39,670
Michael.

384
00:46:39,750 --> 00:46:42,170
No, I wouldn't like you better
if you were Ingrid Bergman.

385
00:46:42,250 --> 00:46:44,050
What's the matter?

386
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:03,610
They don't say if he's dead or alive.

387
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:29,170
- Sonny, it's Michael.
- Where have you been?

388
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:32,010
- Is he all right?
- We don't know yet.

389
00:47:32,090 --> 00:47:36,139
There are all kinds of stories.
He was hit bad, Mikey.

390
00:47:38,099 --> 00:47:41,349
- Are you there?
- Yeah, I'm here.

391
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:46,360
- Where have you been? I was worried.
- Didn't Tom tell you I called?

392
00:47:46,440 --> 00:47:50,489
No. Look, come home, kid.
You should be with Mama, you hear?

393
00:47:57,949 --> 00:47:59,539
Oh, my God.

394
00:48:03,539 --> 00:48:04,960
Sonny!

395
00:48:13,840 --> 00:48:16,139
Stay back there.

396
00:48:16,219 --> 00:48:18,889
- Who is it?
- Open up, it's Clemenza.

397
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:24,559
There's more news about your old man.

398
00:48:24,650 --> 00:48:26,820
Word is out that he's already dead.

399
00:48:27,230 --> 00:48:31,150
- What's the matter with you?
- Take it easy!

400
00:48:31,320 --> 00:48:34,570
- Where was Paulie?
- Sick. He's been sick all winter.

401
00:48:34,659 --> 00:48:37,079
- How often?
- Only three, four times.

402
00:48:37,159 --> 00:48:40,949
-Freddy didn't want a new bodyguard.
- Pick him up now.

403
00:48:41,039 --> 00:48:45,880
I don't care how sick he is. Bring him
to my father's house right now.

404
00:48:45,960 --> 00:48:49,050
- You want anyone sent over here?
- No. Go ahead.

405
00:48:58,219 --> 00:49:02,230
I'm going to have a couple of our people
come over to the house.

406
00:49:05,150 --> 00:49:07,309
- Hello?
- Santino Corleone?

407
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,230
- Yeah.
- We have Tom Hagen.

408
00:49:10,320 --> 00:49:14,030
In three hours he'll be released
with our proposition.

409
00:49:14,110 --> 00:49:17,449
Listen to what he has to say
before you do anything.

410
00:49:17,530 --> 00:49:22,159
What's done is done. Don't lose that
famous temper of yours, Sonny.

411
00:49:22,250 --> 00:49:23,960
I'll wait.

412
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,309
Your boss is dead.

413
00:49:43,139 --> 00:49:47,559
I know you're not in the muscle end
of the family, so don't be scared.

414
00:49:48,650 --> 00:49:52,530
I want you to help the Corleones
and me.

415
00:49:56,489 --> 00:50:00,989
We got him outside his office
about an hour after we picked you up.

416
00:50:02,409 --> 00:50:03,699
Drink it.

417
00:50:08,460 --> 00:50:11,920
It's up to you to make peace
between me and Sonny.

418
00:50:16,130 --> 00:50:18,929
Sonny was hot for my deal, wasn't he?

419
00:50:20,300 --> 00:50:23,139
And you knew
it was the right thing to do.

420
00:50:24,309 --> 00:50:29,440
- Sonny will come after you.
- That will be his first reaction, sure.

421
00:50:30,860 --> 00:50:37,360
So you have to talk sense into him.
The Tattaglia family is behind me.

422
00:50:37,449 --> 00:50:42,530
The other New York families will go
along with anything to prevent war.

423
00:50:42,619 --> 00:50:47,829
Let's face it, with all due respect,
the Don - rest in peace - was slipping.

424
00:50:50,829 --> 00:50:53,840
Ten years ago,
could I have gotten to him?

425
00:50:57,719 --> 00:51:01,679
Well, now he's dead, Tom,
and nothing can bring him back.

426
00:51:03,469 --> 00:51:09,349
You've got to talk to Sonny, to the
Caporegimes, Tessio, fat Clemenza.

427
00:51:14,320 --> 00:51:16,400
It's good business, Tom.

428
00:51:17,780 --> 00:51:22,619
I'll try. But even Sonny won't be able
to call off Luca Brasi.

429
00:51:25,659 --> 00:51:27,449
Yeah, well...

430
00:51:29,289 --> 00:51:31,670
Let me worry about Luca.

431
00:51:36,880 --> 00:51:39,260
You just talk to Sonny.

432
00:51:39,340 --> 00:51:41,590
And the other two kids.

433
00:51:44,550 --> 00:51:47,059
- I'll do my best.
-Good.

434
00:51:49,429 --> 00:51:51,849
Now you can go.

435
00:51:58,690 --> 00:52:03,369
I don't like violence, Tom.
I'm a businessman.

436
00:52:03,449 --> 00:52:05,909
Blood is a big expense.

437
00:52:27,139 --> 00:52:29,019
He's still alive.

438
00:52:29,099 --> 00:52:33,059
They hit him with five shots,
and he's still alive!

439
00:52:33,150 --> 00:52:37,900
That's bad luck for me, and bad luck
for you if you don't make that deal.

440
00:53:22,610 --> 00:53:27,449
Your mother is at the hospital with
your father. Looks like he'll pull through.

441
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:35,920
It's a lot of bad blood. Sollozzo, Philip
Tattaglia, Bruno Tattaglia, Ramon...

442
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,420
- You gonna kill all those guys?
- Stay out of it.

443
00:53:39,500 --> 00:53:41,960
If you get rid of Sollozzo,
everything falls into line.

444
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:46,340
What about Luca?
Sollozzo thinks he can control him.

445
00:53:46,429 --> 00:53:50,219
If Luca sold out, we're in a lot of trouble.

446
00:53:50,309 --> 00:53:53,889
- Has anyone been in touch with Luca?
- We've been trying all night.

447
00:53:53,980 --> 00:53:58,019
- Hey, do me a favor...
- Luca never sleeps over with a broad.

448
00:54:00,110 --> 00:54:05,320
Well, Tom, you're consigliere.
What do we do if the old man dies?

449
00:54:06,449 --> 00:54:12,659
If we lose the old man, we lose the
political contacts and half our strength.

450
00:54:12,739 --> 00:54:18,420
The other New York families might
support Sollozzo to avoid a long war.

451
00:54:18,500 --> 00:54:23,050
This is almost 1946.
Nobody wants bloodshed anymore.

452
00:54:23,130 --> 00:54:24,800
If your father dies

453
00:54:27,219 --> 00:54:28,969
you make the deal.

454
00:54:29,050 --> 00:54:33,929
- Easy to say. He's not your father.
- I'm as much a son as you or Mike.

455
00:54:38,519 --> 00:54:40,019
What is it?

456
00:54:41,019 --> 00:54:46,820
- Paulie, I told you to stay put.
- The guy at the gates has a package.

457
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:49,030
Tessio, go see what it is.

458
00:54:52,369 --> 00:54:54,619
- Shall I stay?
- Yeah. Are you all right?

459
00:54:54,699 --> 00:54:58,460
- I'm fine.
- There's food. Are you hungry?

460
00:54:58,539 --> 00:55:02,130
- No.
- A drink? Brandy will sweat it out.

461
00:55:02,210 --> 00:55:04,840
-Go ahead.
- That might be a good idea.

462
00:55:06,590 --> 00:55:12,639
Take care of that son-of-a-bitch.
Paulie sold out the old man.

463
00:55:12,719 --> 00:55:16,309
- Make that the first thing on your list.
- Understood.

464
00:55:16,389 --> 00:55:20,690
Mickey, tomorrow, get some guys
and go to Luca's apartment.

465
00:55:20,769 --> 00:55:24,480
Maybe we shouldn't get Mike
mixed up in this too directly.

466
00:55:27,030 --> 00:55:30,739
Hanging around the house
on the phone would be a big help.

467
00:55:31,610 --> 00:55:33,530
Try Luca again.

468
00:55:42,460 --> 00:55:45,210
- What's this?
- A Sicilian message.

469
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:48,170
It means Luca Brasi
sleeps with the fishes.

470
00:56:01,900 --> 00:56:03,980
- I'm going.
- When will you be home?

471
00:56:04,059 --> 00:56:05,730
Probably late.

472
00:56:08,280 --> 00:56:11,949
- Don't forget the cannoli!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

473
00:56:14,199 --> 00:56:18,699
Rocco, sit on the other side.
You block the rear-view mirror.

474
00:56:20,250 --> 00:56:23,670
Sonny's running wild. He wants
to go to mattresses already.

475
00:56:23,750 --> 00:56:29,630
We have to find a spot on the
West Side. Try 309 West 43rd Street.

476
00:56:29,710 --> 00:56:33,219
- Know a good spot on the West Side?
- I'll think about it.

477
00:56:33,300 --> 00:56:37,059
Think while you're driving.
I want to hit New York this month.

478
00:56:37,139 --> 00:56:38,889
Watch the kids.

479
00:56:49,780 --> 00:56:55,570
Paulie, go down 39th Street, pick up
18 mattresses and bring me the bill.

480
00:56:55,659 --> 00:56:57,079
Yeah, all right.

481
00:56:57,159 --> 00:57:01,579
Make sure they're clean, because
the guys will be there a long time.

482
00:57:01,659 --> 00:57:05,920
- They're clean and exterminated.
- That's a bad word to use.

483
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:09,960
Exterminate! Watch out,
so we don't exterminate you!

484
00:57:16,679 --> 00:57:19,179
Pull over. I've got to take a leak.

485
00:58:01,059 --> 00:58:04,269
Leave the gun. Take the cannoli.

486
00:58:22,449 --> 00:58:25,329
Hey, Mike! Hey, Mikey!

487
00:58:27,250 --> 00:58:29,380
- Yeah.
- Phone call!

488
00:58:35,420 --> 00:58:37,630
- Who is it?
- Some girl.

489
00:58:41,929 --> 00:58:44,349
- Hello. Kay?
- How's your father?

490
00:58:44,429 --> 00:58:46,429
He's going to make it.

491
00:58:46,889 --> 00:58:48,730
I Iove you.

492
00:58:50,150 --> 00:58:51,769
I Iove you!

493
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:55,239
- Michael?
- Yeah, I know.

494
00:58:55,320 --> 00:58:58,239
- Tell me you love me.
- I can't talk.

495
00:58:58,320 --> 00:59:00,199
Can't you say it?

496
00:59:01,409 --> 00:59:03,280
I'll see you tonight.

497
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:07,210
Why don't you tell that nice girl
you love her?

498
00:59:07,289 --> 00:59:12,090
I love you with all my heart. If I don't
see you again soon, I'm going to die!

499
00:59:13,170 --> 00:59:18,050
Come and learn something. You might
have to cook for 20 guys some day.

500
00:59:18,130 --> 00:59:21,760
You start with a little oil,
then fry some garlic.

501
00:59:21,889 --> 00:59:27,519
Throw in some tomatoes, tomato paste,
fry it and make sure it doesn't stick.

502
00:59:27,599 --> 00:59:31,690
You get it to a boil, you shove in
all your sausage and meatballs.

503
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:35,650
Add a little bit of wine.

504
00:59:38,900 --> 00:59:43,320
And a little bit of sugar. That's my trick.

505
00:59:43,449 --> 00:59:47,699
Cut the crap. I have more important
things for you. How's Paulie?

506
00:59:47,789 --> 00:59:50,000
You won't see him no more.

507
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:53,960
- Where are you going?
- To the city.

508
00:59:54,039 --> 00:59:57,550
- Send bodyguards with him.
- I'm going to the hospital...

509
00:59:57,630 --> 01:00:00,969
He'll be all right.
Sollozzo knows he's a civilian.

510
01:00:01,050 --> 01:00:03,050
- Be careful.
- Yes, sir.

511
01:00:06,179 --> 01:00:08,469
Send somebody with him anyway.

512
01:00:36,539 --> 01:00:39,590
- I have to go.
- Can I go with you?

513
01:00:41,380 --> 01:00:45,719
No, Kay. There will be detectives there,
people from the press.

514
01:00:45,800 --> 01:00:47,929
I'll wait in the cab.

515
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:53,190
I don't want you to get involved.

516
01:00:55,900 --> 01:00:58,150
When will I see you again?

517
01:01:04,489 --> 01:01:08,619
Go back to New Hampshire,
and I'll call you at your parents' house.

518
01:01:10,369 --> 01:01:15,079
- When will I see you again, Michael?
- I don't know.

519
01:03:27,300 --> 01:03:31,139
What are you doing here?
You're not supposed to be here.

520
01:03:31,219 --> 01:03:34,719
I'm Michael Corleone. This is my father.

521
01:03:34,809 --> 01:03:37,139
What happened to the guards?

522
01:03:37,230 --> 01:03:42,650
Your father had too many visitors.
They interfered with hospital service.

523
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:46,070
The police made them leave
about 10 minutes ago.

524
01:03:50,570 --> 01:03:54,530
Get me Long Beach 45620, please.

525
01:03:57,079 --> 01:03:59,409
Nurse. Wait a minute. Stay here.

526
01:04:03,460 --> 01:04:08,300
Sonny, I'm at the hospital.
I got here late, there's nobody here.

527
01:04:08,420 --> 01:04:12,679
No Tessio's men,
no detectives, nobody. Papa's all alone.

528
01:04:12,760 --> 01:04:15,260
- Don't panic.
- I won't panic.

529
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,599
I'm sorry, but you will have to leave.

530
01:04:22,309 --> 01:04:25,150
We're going to move him
to another room.

531
01:04:25,230 --> 01:04:28,230
Can you disconnect the tubes?

532
01:04:28,320 --> 01:04:31,860
- That's out of the question!
- Do you know my father?

533
01:04:31,949 --> 01:04:36,239
Men are coming here to kill him.
Do you understand?

534
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:38,119
Help me, please.

535
01:05:55,199 --> 01:05:58,989
- Who are you?
- I am Enzo, the baker.

536
01:06:00,030 --> 01:06:02,079
- Remember me?
- Enzo.

537
01:06:02,159 --> 01:06:05,289
You'd better go,
there's going to be trouble.

538
01:06:05,369 --> 01:06:10,000
If there is trouble, I'll stay here
to help you. For your father.

539
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:16,130
Listen. Wait for me outside,
in front of the hospital, all right?

540
01:06:16,219 --> 01:06:18,300
I'll be out in a minute.

541
01:06:32,070 --> 01:06:35,820
Just lie here, Pop.
I'll take care of you now.

542
01:06:37,780 --> 01:06:39,820
I'm with you now.

543
01:06:41,449 --> 01:06:42,989
I'm with you.

544
01:07:18,449 --> 01:07:20,610
Get rid of these. Come here.

545
01:07:21,570 --> 01:07:26,000
Put your hand in your pocket,
like you have a gun. You'll be all right.

546
01:08:17,340 --> 01:08:19,010
You did good.

547
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:10,770
I thought all you Guinea hoods
were locked up!

548
01:09:10,890 --> 01:09:15,479
- Why isn't anyone guarding my father?
- You little punk!

549
01:09:15,560 --> 01:09:19,479
Don't you tell me my business!
I pulled them off.

550
01:09:19,609 --> 01:09:25,529
- Stay away from this hospital!
- Not until my father's room is guarded.

551
01:09:26,369 --> 01:09:29,659
- Phil, take him in!
- The kid's clean, Captain.

552
01:09:29,739 --> 01:09:33,579
- He's a war hero. He's never been...
- I said take him in!

553
01:09:35,750 --> 01:09:42,010
- What's The Turk paying you?
- Take a hold of him. Stand him up.

554
01:09:42,090 --> 01:09:43,970
Stand him up straight.

555
01:10:06,109 --> 01:10:11,739
I'm the Corleones' attorney. These men
are hired to protect Vito Corleone.

556
01:10:11,829 --> 01:10:14,250
They're licensed to carry firearms.

557
01:10:14,329 --> 01:10:18,750
If you interfere, you'll have to appear
before the judge and show cause.

558
01:10:18,829 --> 01:10:20,840
Let him go.

559
01:10:53,239 --> 01:10:57,159
- What's with all the new faces?
- We'll need them now.

560
01:10:57,250 --> 01:11:00,130
After the hospital thing, Sonny got mad.

561
01:11:00,210 --> 01:11:03,380
We hit Bruno Tattaglia this morning.

562
01:11:04,510 --> 01:11:06,510
Jesus Christ.

563
01:11:13,180 --> 01:11:15,680
Looks like a fortress around here.

564
01:11:17,810 --> 01:11:23,189
Tamaduch! Hey... 100 buttonmen
on the street 24 hours a day.

565
01:11:23,270 --> 01:11:26,859
That Turk shows one hair on his ass,
he's dead.

566
01:11:28,899 --> 01:11:30,989
Mike, let me look at you.

567
01:11:35,039 --> 01:11:38,079
You're beautiful, beautiful.
You're gorgeous.

568
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:43,789
The Turk wants to talk!
Imagine the nerve of the son-of-a-bitch.

569
01:11:43,880 --> 01:11:46,630
- He wants a meeting today.
- What did he say?

570
01:11:46,760 --> 01:11:51,550
What did he say... He wants us to send
Michael to hear the proposition.

571
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:55,100
He promises that the deal
is too good to refuse.

572
01:11:55,180 --> 01:11:58,270
- And Bruno Tattaglia?
- That's part of the deal.

573
01:11:58,350 --> 01:12:02,649
- He cancels out what they did to Father.
- We should listen to them.

574
01:12:02,729 --> 01:12:05,859
No more! Not this time, Consigliere.

575
01:12:05,939 --> 01:12:09,489
No more meetings, discussions,
or Sollozzo tricks.

576
01:12:09,569 --> 01:12:12,609
I want Sollozzo, or we go to war...

577
01:12:12,699 --> 01:12:15,659
- The other families...
- They hand me Sollozzo!

578
01:12:15,739 --> 01:12:18,039
This is business, not personal!

579
01:12:18,119 --> 01:12:22,539
- They shot my father...
- Even that was business, not personal.

580
01:12:23,460 --> 01:12:27,210
Then business will have to suffer.
Do me a favor.

581
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:31,300
No more advice on how
to patch things up. Just help me win.

582
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:41,520
I found out about Captain McCluskey,
who broke Mike's jaw.

583
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:45,899
He's definitely on Sollozzo's payroll,
and for big money.

584
01:12:45,979 --> 01:12:50,029
McCluskey has agreed
to be The Turk's bodyguard.

585
01:12:50,109 --> 01:12:53,859
So when Sollozzo is being guarded,
he's invulnerable.

586
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:57,529
Nobody has ever gunned down
a New York police captain.

587
01:12:57,659 --> 01:13:03,579
All the families would come after you.
The Corleone family would be outcasts!

588
01:13:03,670 --> 01:13:07,500
Even the old man's political protection
would run for cover.

589
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,630
Do me a favor.
Take this into consideration.

590
01:13:16,470 --> 01:13:18,470
All right, we'll wait.

591
01:13:23,890 --> 01:13:26,729
We can't wait. We can't wait.

592
01:13:28,189 --> 01:13:32,149
No matter what Sollozzo says,
he's going to kill Pop.

593
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:35,949
That's the key for him.
We've got to get Sollozzo.

594
01:13:36,029 --> 01:13:40,329
- Mike is right.
- Let me ask you something.

595
01:13:40,409 --> 01:13:45,000
What about this McCluskey?
What do we do with this cop?

596
01:13:50,170 --> 01:13:53,050
They want to have a meeting
with me, right?

597
01:13:53,920 --> 01:13:58,350
It will be me, McCluskey and Sollozzo.

598
01:14:00,350 --> 01:14:02,350
Let's set the meeting.

599
01:14:04,520 --> 01:14:08,229
Get our informers to find out
where it's going to be held.

600
01:14:10,069 --> 01:14:13,859
We insist it's a public place.
A bar, a restaurant.

601
01:14:13,939 --> 01:14:17,699
Some place where there are people,
so I feel safe.

602
01:14:20,449 --> 01:14:23,449
They'll search me
when I meet them, right?

603
01:14:23,539 --> 01:14:25,869
So I can't have a weapon on me.

604
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:34,210
But if Clemenza can figure out a way to
have a weapon planted there for me

605
01:14:39,180 --> 01:14:41,390
then I'll kill them both.

606
01:14:53,479 --> 01:14:58,199
Nice college boy. Didn't want to
get mixed up in the family business.

607
01:14:58,319 --> 01:15:01,949
Now you want to shoot a police captain
because he slapped you?

608
01:15:02,079 --> 01:15:08,579
This isn't like the army! You have to get
close and get their brains on your suit.

609
01:15:08,670 --> 01:15:11,710
You're taking this very personal.

610
01:15:11,789 --> 01:15:15,210
Tom, this is business
and he's taking it personal.

611
01:15:15,340 --> 01:15:18,800
- Where does it say you can't kill a cop?
- Mikey...

612
01:15:18,930 --> 01:15:25,020
I'm talking about a cop who's mixed up
in drugs, a dishonest cop.

613
01:15:26,060 --> 01:15:30,350
A cop who got mixed up in the rackets
and got what was coming.

614
01:15:30,479 --> 01:15:35,029
That's a terrific story. We have
newspaper people on the payroll, right?

615
01:15:36,489 --> 01:15:40,319
- They might like a story like that.
- They might.

616
01:15:43,989 --> 01:15:47,579
It's not personal, Sonny.
It's strictly business.

617
01:15:50,789 --> 01:15:52,329
It's as cold as they come.

618
01:15:52,420 --> 01:15:55,670
Impossible to trace,
so you don't worry about prints.

619
01:15:56,090 --> 01:16:00,130
I put a special tape on the trigger
and the butt. Try it.

620
01:16:12,310 --> 01:16:14,399
Is the trigger too tight?

621
01:16:17,729 --> 01:16:18,939
My ears!

622
01:16:19,029 --> 01:16:23,659
I left it noisy, so it scares away any
pain-in-the-ass innocent bystanders.

623
01:16:24,829 --> 01:16:27,739
You've shot them both.
Now what do you do?

624
01:16:30,119 --> 01:16:33,789
- Sit down, finish my dinner.
- Don't fool around.

625
01:16:33,880 --> 01:16:37,420
Let your hand drop to your side
and let the gun slip out.

626
01:16:37,500 --> 01:16:41,930
Everybody will still think you've got it.
They'll stare at your face,

627
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,890
so walk out fast, but don't run.

628
01:16:44,970 --> 01:16:48,390
Don't look anybody in the eye,
but don't look away either.

629
01:16:48,470 --> 01:16:51,979
They'll be scared stiff,
so don't worry about nothing.

630
01:16:54,020 --> 01:16:58,279
You'll be all right. You'll take a vacation,
nobody knows where,

631
01:16:58,359 --> 01:17:00,439
and we'll catch the hell.

632
01:17:01,069 --> 01:17:04,909
- How bad do you think it will be?
- Pretty goddamn bad.

633
01:17:04,989 --> 01:17:08,039
All the other families will probably
line up against us.

634
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,710
These things have to happen every five,
10 years. Gets rid of the bad blood.

635
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:18,250
Been 10 years since the last one.
You have to stop them at the beginning.

636
01:17:18,380 --> 01:17:24,090
Like they should have stopped Hitler in
Munich, not letting him get away with it.

637
01:17:25,510 --> 01:17:30,020
You know, Mike, we were all proud
of you. Being a hero and all.

638
01:17:30,100 --> 01:17:31,810
Your father too.

639
01:18:09,890 --> 01:18:13,310
Nothing. Not a hint. Absolutely nothing.

640
01:18:14,270 --> 01:18:18,520
Even Sollozzo's people don't know
where the meeting will be held.

641
01:18:18,609 --> 01:18:20,939
How much time do we have?

642
01:18:21,819 --> 01:18:26,609
They're going to pick you up outside
Jack Dempsey's in an hour and a half.

643
01:18:27,609 --> 01:18:32,489
- We could put a tail on them.
- Sollozzo would lose our ass.

644
01:18:33,869 --> 01:18:38,420
- What about the negotiator?
- He's playing pinochle with my men.

645
01:18:38,539 --> 01:18:43,630
- He's happy. They're letting him win.
- Too risky. Maybe we should call it off.

646
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:47,090
The negotiator plays cards
until Mike is back safe.

647
01:18:47,180 --> 01:18:51,220
- He could blast whoever is in the car.
- They'll expect that.

648
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:54,640
Sollozzo might not even be
in the car, Sonny!

649
01:18:54,729 --> 01:18:56,229
I'll get it.

650
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:23,670
Louis' restaurant in the Bronx.

651
01:19:23,750 --> 01:19:27,090
- Is it reliable?
- My man in McCluskey's precinct.

652
01:19:27,220 --> 01:19:32,930
A police captain is on call 24 hours
a day. He'll be there between 8 and 10.

653
01:19:33,010 --> 01:19:37,890
- Anybody know this joint?
- Sure, I do. It's perfect for us.

654
01:19:37,979 --> 01:19:42,939
A small family place, good food.
Everyone minds his business. Perfect.

655
01:19:43,689 --> 01:19:48,859
They've got an old-fashioned toilet.
You know, the box and the chain thing.

656
01:19:50,859 --> 01:19:53,949
We might be able to
tape the gun behind it.

657
01:19:54,029 --> 01:19:58,159
All right. Mike, you go to the restaurant,

658
01:19:58,250 --> 01:20:02,130
you eat, talk for a while, you relax.
Make them relax.

659
01:20:02,210 --> 01:20:07,550
Then you go to take a leak. No,
better still, you ask permission to go.

660
01:20:07,630 --> 01:20:12,090
Then you come back blasting.
Two shots in the head apiece.

661
01:20:13,850 --> 01:20:16,350
I want somebody very good
to plant that gun.

662
01:20:16,430 --> 01:20:19,939
I don't want him coming out
with just his dick.

663
01:20:20,020 --> 01:20:25,569
- The gun will be there.
- You drive him and pick him up.

664
01:20:25,649 --> 01:20:27,319
Let's move.

665
01:20:32,819 --> 01:20:35,989
Did he tell you to drop the gun
right away?

666
01:20:36,079 --> 01:20:37,949
Yeah, a million times.

667
01:20:42,710 --> 01:20:46,920
Don't forget. Two shots apiece
in the head as soon as you come out.

668
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:57,100
How long do you think it will be
before I can come back?

669
01:20:57,930 --> 01:21:00,020
At least a year.

670
01:21:00,140 --> 01:21:04,939
I'll square it with Mom, that you're not
seeing her before you leave and...

671
01:21:06,479 --> 01:21:10,319
I'll get a message to that girlfriend
when the time is right.

672
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:17,659
Take care.

673
01:21:20,449 --> 01:21:22,210
Take care, Mike.

674
01:21:55,029 --> 01:21:58,829
I'm glad you came. I hope
we can straighten everything out.

675
01:22:00,039 --> 01:22:05,119
It's not the way I wanted things to go.
It should never have happened.

676
01:22:05,250 --> 01:22:09,539
I want to straighten everything out.
I don't want my father bothered again.

677
01:22:09,630 --> 01:22:12,880
I swear on my children
that he won't be, Mike.

678
01:22:13,880 --> 01:22:17,180
But you have to keep an open mind
when we talk.

679
01:22:17,260 --> 01:22:21,680
I hope you're not a hothead like Sonny.
You can't talk business with him.

680
01:22:23,560 --> 01:22:25,229
He's a good kid.

681
01:22:29,310 --> 01:22:32,689
I'm sorry about the other night, Mike.

682
01:22:32,779 --> 01:22:36,859
I've got to frisk you, so turn around.
On your knees, facing me.

683
01:22:41,989 --> 01:22:46,670
I guess I'm getting too old for my job.
Too grouchy.

684
01:22:48,079 --> 01:22:51,920
Can't stand the aggravation.
You know how it is.

685
01:22:54,210 --> 01:22:55,630
He's clean.

686
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:24,539
Going to Jersey?

687
01:23:27,039 --> 01:23:28,579
Maybe.

688
01:23:53,859 --> 01:23:55,649
Nice work, Lou.

689
01:24:32,810 --> 01:24:38,359
- How's the food in this restaurant?
- Try the veal. It's the best in the city.

690
01:24:38,439 --> 01:24:40,109
I'll have it.

691
01:25:15,689 --> 01:25:18,859
- I'm going to speak Italian to Mikey.
-Go ahead.

692
01:26:38,479 --> 01:26:40,149
What I want...

693
01:26:41,109 --> 01:26:43,279
What's most important to me

694
01:26:46,029 --> 01:26:50,239
is that I have a guarantee.
No more attempts on my father's life.

695
01:26:50,329 --> 01:26:55,079
What guarantees can I give you?
I'm the hunted one!

696
01:26:55,159 --> 01:26:58,710
I missed my chance.
You think too much of me, kid.

697
01:26:58,789 --> 01:27:00,630
I'm not that clever.

698
01:27:02,130 --> 01:27:04,380
All I want is a truce.

699
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,770
I have to go to the bathroom.
Is it all right?

700
01:27:16,140 --> 01:27:18,649
When you got to go, you got to go.

701
01:27:24,149 --> 01:27:26,069
He's clean.

702
01:27:26,149 --> 01:27:28,239
Don't take too long.

703
01:27:31,369 --> 01:27:33,159
I've frisked a thousand punks.

704
01:32:23,779 --> 01:32:25,789
Okay, you take over.

705
01:32:43,050 --> 01:32:44,890
I love you, Grandpa.

706
01:32:47,810 --> 01:32:50,520
I'm sorry, Pa. He doesn't know you yet.

707
01:32:51,850 --> 01:32:54,939
- Hey, big guy. Give it to Grandpa.
- Okay.

708
01:32:55,060 --> 01:33:01,319
"I hope you get well, Grandpa, and wish
I see you soon. Your grandson Frank."

709
01:33:04,319 --> 01:33:06,619
Go with your mother.

710
01:33:06,699 --> 01:33:08,829
Take them downstairs.

711
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,000
Go on, Carlo, you too.

712
01:33:18,710 --> 01:33:20,420
Go on.

713
01:33:41,029 --> 01:33:45,029
- What's the matter with you, Carlo?
- Shut up and set the table.

714
01:34:00,590 --> 01:34:06,640
Since McCluskey's killing, the police
have cracked down on our operations.

715
01:34:08,390 --> 01:34:13,270
And also the other families.
There's been a lot of bad blood.

716
01:34:13,350 --> 01:34:16,850
They hit us, so we hit them back.

717
01:34:17,689 --> 01:34:22,229
Through our newspaper contacts
we've been able to put out material

718
01:34:22,319 --> 01:34:26,609
about McCluskey's link with Sollozzo
in the drug rackets.

719
01:34:26,699 --> 01:34:28,819
So things are loosening up.

720
01:34:30,079 --> 01:34:34,829
And I'm sending Fredo to Las Vegas,

721
01:34:34,909 --> 01:34:37,460
under the protection
of Don Francesco of L.A.

722
01:34:37,579 --> 01:34:42,090
- I want him to rest.
- I'm going to learn the casino business.

723
01:34:50,430 --> 01:34:52,220
Where's Michael?

724
01:35:04,529 --> 01:35:07,659
It was Michael who killed Sollozzo.

725
01:35:09,449 --> 01:35:13,289
But he's safe. We're starting to work
to bring him back.

726
01:35:34,680 --> 01:35:37,060
I want you to find out
where that old pimp Tattaglia is hiding.

727
01:35:37,140 --> 01:35:39,100
I want him now.

728
01:35:39,189 --> 01:35:42,729
Sonny, things are starting to loosen up.

729
01:35:42,819 --> 01:35:47,529
If you go after Tattaglia, all hell
will break loose. Pop can negotiate.

730
01:35:47,609 --> 01:35:53,619
- He must get better first. I'll decide...
- War is costly. We can't do business.

731
01:35:53,699 --> 01:35:57,539
- Neither can they. Don't worry about it!
- We can't afford a stalemate.

732
01:35:57,659 --> 01:36:02,590
- No more stalemate. I'll kill the bastard!
- You're getting a great reputation!

733
01:36:02,710 --> 01:36:08,760
Do as I say! If I had a Sicilian wartime
consigliere, I wouldn't be in this shape!

734
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:11,140
Pop had Genco. Look what I got.

735
01:36:14,720 --> 01:36:17,020
I'm sorry. I didn't mean that.

736
01:36:18,180 --> 01:36:21,149
Ma made a little dinner. It's Sunday.

737
01:36:22,060 --> 01:36:26,439
Niggers are having a good time
with our policy banks in Harlem.

738
01:36:26,529 --> 01:36:30,699
Driving new Cadillacs,
paying 50% on a bet.

739
01:36:30,779 --> 01:36:34,119
That's because
they've started making big money.

740
01:36:34,199 --> 01:36:37,500
Papa never talked business
at the table.

741
01:36:37,579 --> 01:36:41,460
- Shut up, Connie...
- Don't you ever tell her to shut up.

742
01:36:42,210 --> 01:36:43,289
Don't interfere.

743
01:36:45,590 --> 01:36:49,510
I'd like to talk to you after dinner.
I could do more for the family...

744
01:36:49,590 --> 01:36:52,380
We don't discuss business at the table.

745
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:42,229
I kiss your hand, Don Tommasino.

746
01:37:47,770 --> 01:37:49,779
Why are you so far
from the house?

747
01:37:50,439 --> 01:37:53,109
You know I'm responsible to your
father for your life.

748
01:37:53,199 --> 01:37:54,489
The bodyguards are here.

749
01:37:55,409 --> 01:37:56,739
It's still dangerous...

750
01:37:57,869 --> 01:37:59,619
We've heard from Santino
in New York...

751
01:38:01,039 --> 01:38:03,289
Your enemies know you're here.

752
01:38:05,289 --> 01:38:07,039
Did Santino say when
I can go back?

753
01:38:07,710 --> 01:38:09,000
Not yet.

754
01:38:09,670 --> 01:38:11,510
It's out of the question.

755
01:38:14,970 --> 01:38:16,390
Where are you going now?

756
01:38:18,050 --> 01:38:19,100
To Corleone.

757
01:38:19,720 --> 01:38:20,970
Take my car.

758
01:38:24,310 --> 01:38:25,350
I want to walk.

759
01:38:27,979 --> 01:38:29,149
Be careful.

760
01:39:03,680 --> 01:39:05,060
Where have all the men gone?

761
01:39:06,100 --> 01:39:08,310
They're all dead from vendettas.

762
01:39:09,939 --> 01:39:12,359
There are the names of the dead.

763
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:32,880
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !

764
01:39:32,960 --> 01:39:37,260
Hey, hey, take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable!

765
01:39:37,380 --> 01:39:42,640
America! Take me to the America, G. I. !
Clark Gable, Rita Hayworth!

766
01:40:00,569 --> 01:40:02,619
Mamma mia what a beauty.

767
01:40:10,789 --> 01:40:13,880
I think you got hit
by the thunderbolt.

768
01:40:20,090 --> 01:40:24,100
In Sicily women are more
dangerous than shotguns.

769
01:40:46,789 --> 01:40:48,949
Did you have a good hunt?

770
01:40:49,909 --> 01:40:52,289
You know all the girls
around here?

771
01:40:52,789 --> 01:40:54,289
We saw some real beauties.

772
01:40:55,130 --> 01:40:58,630
One of them struck our friend
like a thunderbolt.

773
01:41:01,840 --> 01:41:04,600
She would tempt the devil himself.

774
01:41:12,229 --> 01:41:14,399
Really put together.

775
01:41:14,479 --> 01:41:15,520
Right, Calo?

776
01:41:19,279 --> 01:41:21,279
Such hair, such mouth!

777
01:41:23,659 --> 01:41:26,829
The girls around here are
beautiful...but virtuous.

778
01:41:27,369 --> 01:41:29,750
This one had a purple dress...

779
01:41:30,119 --> 01:41:32,250
And a purple ribbon in her hair.

780
01:41:33,119 --> 01:41:36,289
A type more Greek than Italian.

781
01:41:38,710 --> 01:41:40,550
Do you know her?

782
01:41:44,970 --> 01:41:47,760
There's no girl like that
in this town.

783
01:41:50,470 --> 01:41:51,680
My God, I understand!

784
01:41:55,810 --> 01:41:56,810
What's wrong?

785
01:41:59,020 --> 01:42:00,399
Let's go.

786
01:42:02,359 --> 01:42:03,609
It's his daughter.

787
01:42:04,069 --> 01:42:05,569
Tell him to come here.

788
01:42:08,989 --> 01:42:10,329
Call him.

789
01:42:30,390 --> 01:42:32,720
Fabrizio, you translate.

790
01:42:36,850 --> 01:42:38,729
I apologize if I offended you.

791
01:42:39,729 --> 01:42:43,149
I'm a stranger in this country.

792
01:42:43,239 --> 01:42:46,319
I meant no disrespect
to you or your daughter.

793
01:42:51,789 --> 01:42:54,659
I'm an American, hiding in Sicily.

794
01:42:56,079 --> 01:42:58,420
My name is Michael Corleone.

795
01:43:00,460 --> 01:43:04,590
There are people who'd pay
a lot of money for that information.

796
01:43:06,760 --> 01:43:09,800
But then your daughter
would lose a father

797
01:43:11,390 --> 01:43:13,770
instead of gaining a husband.

798
01:43:21,939 --> 01:43:24,149
I want to meet your daughter.

799
01:43:24,819 --> 01:43:29,409
With your permission, and under
the supervision of your family.

800
01:43:30,069 --> 01:43:31,739
With all respect.

801
01:43:37,789 --> 01:43:41,789
Come to my house Sunday morning.
My name is Vitelli.

802
01:43:47,300 --> 01:43:48,800
What's her name?

803
01:46:44,140 --> 01:46:46,310
I'll knock you dizzy.

804
01:46:52,069 --> 01:46:54,149
Save it for the library.

805
01:46:57,819 --> 01:47:00,489
We've got to pick up my sister.

806
01:47:18,550 --> 01:47:20,260
What's the matter?

807
01:47:22,720 --> 01:47:24,520
What's the matter?

808
01:47:26,310 --> 01:47:28,229
- It was my fault!
- Where is he?

809
01:47:28,310 --> 01:47:31,479
It was my fault. I hit him.

810
01:47:31,569 --> 01:47:35,359
I started a fight with him.
I hit him, so he hit me...

811
01:47:40,569 --> 01:47:43,869
I'm just going to get a doctor
to take a look at you.

812
01:47:43,949 --> 01:47:46,460
Sonny, please don't do anything.

813
01:47:48,420 --> 01:47:50,500
What's the matter with you?
What am I going to do?

814
01:47:50,579 --> 01:47:53,460
Make that baby an orphan
before he's born?

815
01:47:58,010 --> 01:48:01,220
You spic slobs still betting Yankees?

816
01:48:01,300 --> 01:48:03,970
Tell them to stop taking in action.

817
01:48:04,810 --> 01:48:06,520
We lost enough money last week.

818
01:48:13,649 --> 01:48:15,689
Come here, come here!

819
01:49:12,619 --> 01:49:15,960
If you touch my sister again, I'll kill you.

820
01:53:09,189 --> 01:53:13,449
Hey! We weren't expecting you, Kay.
You should call.

821
01:53:13,529 --> 01:53:17,869
Yes, I have. I've tried writing and calling.

822
01:53:17,949 --> 01:53:21,789
- I want to reach Michael.
- Nobody knows where he is.

823
01:53:21,869 --> 01:53:24,420
All we know is that he's all right.

824
01:53:26,960 --> 01:53:30,590
- What was that?
- An accident, but nobody was hurt.

825
01:53:31,720 --> 01:53:35,850
Tom, will you give this letter to Michael.
Please?

826
01:53:37,390 --> 01:53:42,560
If I accepted that, a court could prove
I have knowledge of his whereabouts.

827
01:53:43,560 --> 01:53:45,439
He'll get in touch with you.

828
01:53:45,560 --> 01:53:49,229
I let my cab go,
so can I call another one, please?

829
01:53:49,319 --> 01:53:51,189
Come on. Sorry.

830
01:54:08,420 --> 01:54:13,090
- Hello?
- Is Carlo there?

831
01:54:13,880 --> 01:54:16,340
- Who is this?
- A friend of Carlo.

832
01:54:16,430 --> 01:54:19,810
Tell him that I can't make it tonight
until later.

833
01:54:25,560 --> 01:54:26,810
Bitch!

834
01:54:28,819 --> 01:54:31,609
- Dinner's on the table.
- I'm not hungry.

835
01:54:31,689 --> 01:54:35,029
- The food is getting cold.
- I'll eat out later.

836
01:54:35,109 --> 01:54:38,489
- You just told me to make you dinner!
- VafangooI!

837
01:54:38,699 --> 01:54:40,829
I'll vafangool you!

838
01:54:45,670 --> 01:54:48,460
She has a filthy mouth, this Guinea brat.

839
01:54:52,800 --> 01:54:57,140
That's it, break it all,
you spoiled Guinea brat. Break it all!

840
01:55:06,350 --> 01:55:09,479
Why don't you bring
your whore home for dinner?

841
01:55:10,479 --> 01:55:12,149
Maybe I will.

842
01:55:18,909 --> 01:55:22,079
- Clean it up!
- Like hell I will!

843
01:55:22,159 --> 01:55:26,079
You skinny, spoiled brat.
Clean it up! Clean it up!

844
01:55:26,159 --> 01:55:30,670
Clean it up! I said, clean it up!
Clean it up!

845
01:55:30,750 --> 01:55:35,590
Clean it up. Clean that up, you...

846
01:55:38,840 --> 01:55:40,550
Clean it!

847
01:55:40,640 --> 01:55:44,890
Clean it up! Yeah, kill me.
Be a murderer, like your father!

848
01:55:44,970 --> 01:55:48,439
- All you Corleones are murderers!
- I hate you!

849
01:55:48,520 --> 01:55:50,229
Come on, kill me!

850
01:55:51,770 --> 01:55:53,439
Get out of here!

851
01:55:53,520 --> 01:55:56,949
- I hate you!
- Now I'll kill you.

852
01:55:57,029 --> 01:55:59,699
You Guinea brat. Get out of here!

853
01:56:10,170 --> 01:56:13,130
Connie, what's the matter?
I can't hear you.

854
01:56:14,250 --> 01:56:17,300
Connie, talk louder. The baby's crying.

855
01:56:17,380 --> 01:56:20,300
Santino, I can't understand.
I don't know.

856
01:56:21,590 --> 01:56:23,390
Yeah, Connie.

857
01:56:28,060 --> 01:56:30,020
You wait there.

858
01:56:32,649 --> 01:56:35,189
No, you just wait there.

859
01:56:37,359 --> 01:56:39,609
Son-of-a-bitch.

860
01:56:39,699 --> 01:56:42,909
- Son-of-a-bitch!
- What's the matter?

861
01:56:47,079 --> 01:56:50,159
Open the goddamn gate!
Get off your ass.

862
01:56:58,170 --> 01:56:59,420
Sonny!

863
01:57:05,890 --> 01:57:07,890
- Sonny.
-Get out of here!

864
01:57:08,979 --> 01:57:10,850
Go after him, go on!

865
01:57:40,590 --> 01:57:42,630
Son-of-a-bitch. Come on!

866
01:59:31,329 --> 01:59:33,159
Give me a drop.

867
01:59:41,590 --> 01:59:43,880
My wife is crying upstairs.

868
01:59:46,260 --> 01:59:48,760
I hear cars coming to the house.

869
01:59:53,430 --> 01:59:56,350
Consigliere of mine,

870
01:59:56,430 --> 01:59:59,939
tell your Don
what everyone seems to know.

871
02:00:00,020 --> 02:00:02,399
I didn't tell Mama anything.

872
02:00:03,359 --> 02:00:06,609
I was about to come up and wake you
and tell you.

873
02:00:10,109 --> 02:00:12,329
But you needed a drink first.

874
02:00:14,659 --> 02:00:15,909
Yeah.

875
02:00:19,210 --> 02:00:21,710
Well, now you've had your drink.

876
02:00:27,260 --> 02:00:31,140
They shot Sonny on the causeway.
He's dead.

877
02:00:48,189 --> 02:00:50,739
I want no inquiries made.

878
02:00:55,199 --> 02:00:57,750
I want no acts of vengeance.

879
02:00:59,460 --> 02:01:02,289
I want you to arrange a meeting

880
02:01:03,289 --> 02:01:05,920
with the heads of the five families.

881
02:01:07,840 --> 02:01:09,920
This war stops now.

882
02:01:31,859 --> 02:01:34,409
Call Bonasera.

883
02:01:34,489 --> 02:01:36,659
I need him now.

884
02:01:49,050 --> 02:01:54,220
This is Tom Hagen. I'm calling
for Vito Corleone, at his request.

885
02:01:54,300 --> 02:01:56,680
You owe your Don a service.

886
02:01:56,760 --> 02:02:00,310
He has no doubt that you will repay it.

887
02:02:00,390 --> 02:02:04,729
He will be at your funeral parlor
in one hour. Be there to greet him.

888
02:02:25,920 --> 02:02:30,710
Well, my friend, are you ready
to do me this service?

889
02:02:30,800 --> 02:02:33,880
Yes. What do you want me to do?

890
02:02:42,270 --> 02:02:46,729
I want you to use all your powers
and all your skills.

891
02:02:50,899 --> 02:02:53,819
I don't want his mother
to see him this way.

892
02:03:09,840 --> 02:03:12,960
Look how they massacred my boy.

893
02:03:41,989 --> 02:03:45,250
It's safer to teach you English!

894
02:03:46,000 --> 02:03:47,420
I know English...

895
02:03:47,500 --> 02:03:52,289
Monday, Tuesday, Thursday,
Wednesday, Friday, Sunday, Saturday.

896
02:03:59,510 --> 02:04:01,300
Greetings, Don Tommasino.

897
02:04:02,010 --> 02:04:04,010
How are things in Palermo?

898
02:04:10,020 --> 02:04:14,069
Michael is teaching me to
drive...watch, I'll show you.

899
02:04:16,859 --> 02:04:18,699
How are things in Palermo?

900
02:04:19,069 --> 02:04:22,199
Young people don't respect
anything anymore...

901
02:04:23,279 --> 02:04:26,659
times are changing for the worse.

902
02:04:28,909 --> 02:04:32,329
This place has become
too dangerous for you.

903
02:04:35,050 --> 02:04:40,220
I want you to move to a villa
near Siracusa...right now.

904
02:04:46,220 --> 02:04:47,390
What's wrong?

905
02:04:48,520 --> 02:04:50,729
Bad news from America.

906
02:04:53,189 --> 02:04:56,899
Your brother, Santino,
they killed him.

907
02:05:03,489 --> 02:05:05,329
Let's go...you promised.

908
02:05:24,140 --> 02:05:25,140
Fabrizio!

909
02:05:25,220 --> 02:05:26,640
Get the car.

910
02:05:28,020 --> 02:05:32,189
Are you driving yourself, Boss?
Is your wife coming with you?

911
02:05:32,270 --> 02:05:35,859
No, take her to her father's house
until things are safe.

912
02:05:35,939 --> 02:05:37,859
Okay, anything you say.

913
02:05:43,779 --> 02:05:45,529
Calo, where is Apollonia?

914
02:05:46,279 --> 02:05:49,789
She's going to surprise you.
She wants to drive.

915
02:05:52,079 --> 02:05:54,119
She'll make a good American wife.

916
02:05:55,579 --> 02:05:58,130
Wait, I'll get the baggage.

917
02:06:08,390 --> 02:06:10,560
Fabrizio!

918
02:06:10,640 --> 02:06:12,310
Where are you going?

919
02:06:14,020 --> 02:06:16,439
Wait there! I'll drive to you.

920
02:06:22,569 --> 02:06:23,989
No, Apollonia!

921
02:06:47,050 --> 02:06:52,890
Don Barzini, I want to thank you
for helping me organize this meeting,

922
02:06:53,020 --> 02:06:57,859
and the other heads of the five families
from New York and New Jersey.

923
02:06:59,609 --> 02:07:02,739
Carmine Cuneo from the Bronx,

924
02:07:02,819 --> 02:07:06,159
and from Brooklyn

925
02:07:07,779 --> 02:07:09,869
Philip Tattaglia.

926
02:07:11,659 --> 02:07:14,369
And from Staten Island

927
02:07:14,460 --> 02:07:17,960
we have with us Victor Strachi.

928
02:07:18,039 --> 02:07:23,670
And the other associates that came as
far as from California and Kansas City

929
02:07:23,760 --> 02:07:27,510
and all the other territories
of the country. Thank you.

930
02:07:34,350 --> 02:07:37,810
How did things ever get so far?

931
02:07:37,899 --> 02:07:39,520
I don't know.

932
02:07:41,569 --> 02:07:45,069
It was so unfortunate, so unnecessary.

933
02:07:48,199 --> 02:07:51,619
Tattaglia lost a son, and I lost a son.

934
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:57,500
We're quits. And if Tattaglia agrees,

935
02:07:57,579 --> 02:08:01,590
then I'm willing to let things go on
as before.

936
02:08:03,050 --> 02:08:06,670
We're grateful to Don Corleone
for calling this meeting.

937
02:08:06,760 --> 02:08:12,140
We all know him as a man of his word.
A modest man who listens to reason.

938
02:08:12,220 --> 02:08:16,310
Yes, Don Barzini. He's too modest.

939
02:08:16,390 --> 02:08:20,600
He had all the judges and politicians
in his pocket.

940
02:08:20,689 --> 02:08:23,569
He refused to share them.

941
02:08:23,649 --> 02:08:27,439
When did I ever refuse
an accommodation?

942
02:08:27,529 --> 02:08:29,909
All of you know me.

943
02:08:30,819 --> 02:08:35,989
When did I ever refuse,
except one time? And why?

944
02:08:37,659 --> 02:08:43,500
Because I believe this drug business
will destroy us in the years to come.

945
02:08:43,590 --> 02:08:47,840
It's not like gambling or liquor
or even women,

946
02:08:47,920 --> 02:08:53,890
which is something that most people
want, but is forbidden by the Church.

947
02:08:54,010 --> 02:08:58,729
Even the police that have helped us in
the past with gambling and other things

948
02:08:58,810 --> 02:09:03,020
are going to refuse to help us
when it comes to narcotics.

949
02:09:03,109 --> 02:09:08,239
I believed that then
and I believe that now.

950
02:09:08,319 --> 02:09:10,529
Times have changed.

951
02:09:10,649 --> 02:09:15,369
It's not like the old days,
when we could do anything we wanted.

952
02:09:15,449 --> 02:09:18,329
A refusal is not the act of a friend.

953
02:09:18,409 --> 02:09:23,829
If Don Corleone had all the judges and
politicians, then he must share them

954
02:09:23,920 --> 02:09:28,510
or let others use them. He must let us
draw the water from the well.

955
02:09:29,590 --> 02:09:33,180
Certainly he can present a bill
for such services.

956
02:09:33,260 --> 02:09:35,850
After all, we're not communists.

957
02:09:38,970 --> 02:09:42,060
I also don't believe in drugs.

958
02:09:42,189 --> 02:09:47,020
For years I paid my people extra, so
they wouldn't do that kind of business.

959
02:09:47,109 --> 02:09:50,239
Somebody says to them
"I have powders."

960
02:09:50,319 --> 02:09:53,569
"If you put up
3-4,000 dollar investment,

961
02:09:53,859 --> 02:09:56,659
we can make 50,000 distributing."

962
02:09:57,869 --> 02:10:03,789
They can't resist. I want to control it
as a business, keep it respectable.

963
02:10:03,869 --> 02:10:08,670
I don't want it near schools,
I don't want it sold to children.

964
02:10:08,750 --> 02:10:10,550
Thats an infĞÂ mia.

965
02:10:11,880 --> 02:10:15,800
In my city we would keep the traffic
to the colored.

966
02:10:15,890 --> 02:10:19,100
They're animals,
so let them lose their souls.

967
02:10:25,729 --> 02:10:29,319
I hoped that we could come here
and reason together.

968
02:10:30,729 --> 02:10:37,369
And I'm willing to do whatever is
necessary to find a peaceful solution.

969
02:10:37,909 --> 02:10:42,500
We are agreed. The traffic in drugs
will be permitted, but controlled.

970
02:10:42,579 --> 02:10:46,880
Don Corleone will give us protection
in the east, and there will be peace.

971
02:10:46,960 --> 02:10:50,710
I must have strict assurance
from Corleone.

972
02:10:50,800 --> 02:10:54,090
As time goes by
and his position becomes stronger,

973
02:10:54,170 --> 02:10:56,840
will he attempt any individual vendetta?

974
02:10:56,930 --> 02:11:02,060
We are all reasonable men.
We don't have to give assurances.

975
02:11:02,140 --> 02:11:05,020
You talk about vengeance.

976
02:11:05,100 --> 02:11:08,359
Will vengeance
bring your son back to you?

977
02:11:08,439 --> 02:11:10,979
Or my boy to me?

978
02:11:11,069 --> 02:11:13,859
I forgo the vengeance of my son.

979
02:11:16,659 --> 02:11:18,949
But I have selfish reasons.

980
02:11:21,239 --> 02:11:24,829
My youngest son was forced
to leave this country

981
02:11:26,710 --> 02:11:29,250
because of this Sollozzo business.

982
02:11:30,789 --> 02:11:34,720
And I have to make arrangements
to bring him back here safely.

983
02:11:34,800 --> 02:11:37,470
Cleared of all these false charges.

984
02:11:38,890 --> 02:11:42,010
But I'm a superstitious man.

985
02:11:42,140 --> 02:11:47,439
If an unlucky accident should befall him,
if he should be shot by a police officer,

986
02:11:48,810 --> 02:11:52,399
or if he should hang himself
in his jail cell,

987
02:11:52,479 --> 02:11:55,359
or if he's struck by a bolt of lightning,

988
02:11:56,649 --> 02:12:00,239
then I'm going to blame
some of the people in this room.

989
02:12:01,909 --> 02:12:04,239
And that I do not forgive.

990
02:12:06,710 --> 02:12:09,079
But, that aside

991
02:12:12,170 --> 02:12:14,500
let me say that I swear

992
02:12:16,130 --> 02:12:19,260
on the souls of my grandchildren,

993
02:12:19,340 --> 02:12:23,720
that I will not be the one to break
the peace we've made here today.

994
02:12:49,210 --> 02:12:54,670
Should I insist that all of Tattaglia's
drug middlemen have clean records?

995
02:12:54,750 --> 02:12:56,880
Mention it. Don't insist.

996
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:03,800
- Barzini will know without being told.
- You mean Tattaglia.

997
02:13:05,430 --> 02:13:07,390
Tattaglia's a pimp.

998
02:13:08,479 --> 02:13:11,600
He could never have outfought Santino.

999
02:13:13,979 --> 02:13:19,569
But I didn't know until this day
that it was Barzini all along.

1000
02:13:35,039 --> 02:13:37,130
Come on, Nancy.

1001
02:13:38,340 --> 02:13:40,920
Keep together, everyone. Brian.

1002
02:13:42,260 --> 02:13:43,930
Okay, all right.

1003
02:13:57,020 --> 02:13:59,229
How long have you been back?

1004
02:14:00,029 --> 02:14:01,859
I've been back a year.

1005
02:14:03,279 --> 02:14:05,409
Longer than that, I think.

1006
02:14:08,239 --> 02:14:10,409
It's good to see you, Kay.

1007
02:14:21,470 --> 02:14:24,010
I'm working for my father now, Kay.

1008
02:14:26,510 --> 02:14:29,510
He's been sick. Very sick.

1009
02:14:31,060 --> 02:14:33,020
But you're not like him.

1010
02:14:33,100 --> 02:14:36,899
You told me you weren't going to
become like your father.

1011
02:14:38,819 --> 02:14:43,109
My father is no different
than any other powerful man.

1012
02:14:43,199 --> 02:14:46,659
Any man who's responsible
for other people.

1013
02:14:47,869 --> 02:14:50,289
Like a senator or president.

1014
02:14:50,369 --> 02:14:52,829
- How naive you sound.
- Why?

1015
02:14:52,909 --> 02:14:55,750
They don't have men killed.

1016
02:14:59,170 --> 02:15:01,170
Who's being naive, Kay?

1017
02:15:02,420 --> 02:15:06,680
My father's way of doing things is over.
Even he knows that.

1018
02:15:08,220 --> 02:15:12,600
In five years the Corleone family
is going to be completely legitimate.

1019
02:15:14,430 --> 02:15:18,399
Trust me. That's all I can tell you
about my business. Kay...

1020
02:15:19,859 --> 02:15:22,979
Michael, why did you come here? Why?

1021
02:15:24,279 --> 02:15:29,119
What do you want with me after all
this time? I've been calling and writing.

1022
02:15:29,199 --> 02:15:32,699
I came because I need you.
I care for you.

1023
02:15:32,789 --> 02:15:36,619
- Please stop it, Michael.
- Because... I want you to marry me.

1024
02:15:38,329 --> 02:15:40,920
- It's too late.
- Please, Kay...

1025
02:15:42,670 --> 02:15:46,550
I'll do anything you ask
to make up for what's happened to us.

1026
02:15:48,220 --> 02:15:52,470
Because that's important, Kay.
Because what's important is that

1027
02:15:54,020 --> 02:15:57,270
we have each other.
That we have a life together.

1028
02:15:58,850 --> 02:16:01,569
That we have children. Our children.

1029
02:16:03,069 --> 02:16:05,239
Kay, I need you.

1030
02:16:07,199 --> 02:16:08,779
And I love you.

1031
02:16:30,930 --> 02:16:34,680
Barzini's people chisel my territory
and we do nothing about it!

1032
02:16:34,809 --> 02:16:38,440
- Soon I'll have no place to hang my hat!
- Be patient.

1033
02:16:38,520 --> 02:16:41,649
I'm not asking for help.
Just take off the handcuffs.

1034
02:16:41,729 --> 02:16:44,860
- Be patient.
- We must protect ourselves.

1035
02:16:44,940 --> 02:16:48,399
- Let me recruit some new men.
- No.

1036
02:16:48,489 --> 02:16:52,370
- Barzini would get an excuse to fight.
- Mike, you're wrong.

1037
02:16:53,870 --> 02:16:56,040
Don Corleone...

1038
02:16:56,120 --> 02:17:00,250
You once said that one day Tessio
and me could form our own family.

1039
02:17:00,329 --> 02:17:04,379
Till today I would never think of it.
I must ask your permission.

1040
02:17:05,379 --> 02:17:08,049
Michael is now head of the family.

1041
02:17:08,129 --> 02:17:12,430
If he gives his permission,
then you have my blessing.

1042
02:17:12,510 --> 02:17:14,889
After we make the move to Nevada

1043
02:17:14,969 --> 02:17:19,389
you can leave the Corleone family
and go on your own.

1044
02:17:19,479 --> 02:17:23,809
- How long will that be?
- Six months.

1045
02:17:23,899 --> 02:17:27,149
Forgive me, but with you gone,

1046
02:17:27,229 --> 02:17:30,069
me and Pete
will come under Barzini's thumb.

1047
02:17:30,149 --> 02:17:35,829
I hate that Barzini. In six months' time
there will be nothing left to build on.

1048
02:17:35,909 --> 02:17:38,829
- Do you have faith in my judgment?
- Yes.

1049
02:17:38,909 --> 02:17:41,829
- Do I have your loyalty?
- Always, Godfather.

1050
02:17:41,920 --> 02:17:45,170
Then be a friend to Michael.
Do as he says.

1051
02:17:50,090 --> 02:17:55,430
Things are negotiated that'll solve your
problems and answer your questions.

1052
02:17:55,510 --> 02:17:57,850
That's all I can tell you now.

1053
02:17:58,680 --> 02:18:01,270
Carlo, you grew up in Nevada.

1054
02:18:01,350 --> 02:18:04,729
When we make our move there,
you'll be my right-hand man.

1055
02:18:04,809 --> 02:18:09,610
Tom Hagen is no longer consigliere.
He'll be our lawyer in Vegas.

1056
02:18:09,690 --> 02:18:12,239
That's no reflection on Tom,
just how I want it.

1057
02:18:12,319 --> 02:18:17,030
If I ever need help, who's a better
consigliere than my father? That's it.

1058
02:18:37,049 --> 02:18:40,889
- Thank you, Papa.
- I'm happy for you, Carlo.

1059
02:18:40,969 --> 02:18:43,889
Mike... Why am I out?

1060
02:18:45,399 --> 02:18:48,110
You're not a wartime consigliere, Tom.

1061
02:18:49,399 --> 02:18:52,649
Things may get rough with the move.

1062
02:18:52,739 --> 02:18:54,030
Tom.

1063
02:18:59,200 --> 02:19:04,370
I advised Michael. I never thought
you were a bad consigliere.

1064
02:19:04,459 --> 02:19:08,590
I thought Santino was a bad Don,
rest in peace.

1065
02:19:10,049 --> 02:19:13,260
Michael has all my confidence,
just as you do.

1066
02:19:14,260 --> 02:19:19,219
But there are reasons why you must
have no part in what is going to happen.

1067
02:19:20,260 --> 02:19:23,309
- Maybe I could help.
- You're out, Tom.

1068
02:20:12,479 --> 02:20:16,780
I can't get over the way your face looks.
So good!

1069
02:20:16,899 --> 02:20:21,489
This doctor did some job.
Did Kay talk you into it? Hey, hey, hey!

1070
02:20:21,569 --> 02:20:25,700
Leave them out here.
He's tired and wants to clean up.

1071
02:20:25,790 --> 02:20:28,159
Let me open the door, all right?

1072
02:20:34,340 --> 02:20:39,760
- Hello, Mike! Welcome to Las Vegas!
- All for you, kid! It's all his idea.

1073
02:20:39,840 --> 02:20:42,469
- Your brother Freddy.
-Girls?

1074
02:20:46,389 --> 02:20:49,479
I'll be right back. Keep them occupied.

1075
02:20:50,690 --> 02:20:54,190
- Anything you want, kid, anything.
- Who are the girls?

1076
02:20:55,610 --> 02:20:59,030
- That's for you to find out.
-Get rid of them, Fredo.

1077
02:21:00,569 --> 02:21:05,239
- Hey, Mike...
- I'm here on business. Get rid of them.

1078
02:21:05,329 --> 02:21:08,000
I'm tired. Get rid of the band too.

1079
02:21:13,879 --> 02:21:17,170
Hey, take off. Take off. Let's go.

1080
02:21:17,260 --> 02:21:19,379
Hey, that's it. Hey, Angelo.

1081
02:21:21,090 --> 02:21:23,219
Hey, come on! Scram!

1082
02:21:24,889 --> 02:21:28,430
Come on, honey. I don't know
what's the matter with him, Johnny.

1083
02:21:28,520 --> 02:21:29,809
Sorry.

1084
02:21:31,770 --> 02:21:34,309
I don't know. He's tired.

1085
02:21:41,319 --> 02:21:44,409
What happened to Moe Greene?

1086
02:21:44,489 --> 02:21:48,829
He had some business. He said to
give him a call when the party started.

1087
02:21:48,909 --> 02:21:50,870
Well, give him a call.

1088
02:21:52,250 --> 02:21:55,379
- Johnny, how are you?
- Nice to see you, Mike.

1089
02:21:55,459 --> 02:21:57,670
- We're proud of you.
- Thanks.

1090
02:21:57,750 --> 02:22:01,340
Sit down, I want to talk to you.
The Don is proud too.

1091
02:22:01,420 --> 02:22:03,680
Well, I owe it all to him.

1092
02:22:04,889 --> 02:22:06,469
He knows how grateful you are.

1093
02:22:06,549 --> 02:22:09,809
That's why
he'd like to ask a favor of you.

1094
02:22:09,889 --> 02:22:11,809
Mike, what can I do?

1095
02:22:12,979 --> 02:22:15,440
We're thinking of giving up our interests

1096
02:22:15,520 --> 02:22:18,440
in the olive oil business
and settling here.

1097
02:22:19,280 --> 02:22:24,610
Moe will sell us his share of the casino
and the hotel, so we'll own all of it.

1098
02:22:24,700 --> 02:22:27,450
- Tom!
- Are you sure?

1099
02:22:27,530 --> 02:22:30,540
Moe loves the business.
He never said nothing about selling.

1100
02:22:30,620 --> 02:22:33,329
I'll make him an offer he can't refuse.

1101
02:22:34,620 --> 02:22:37,040
See, Johnny...

1102
02:22:37,129 --> 02:22:41,340
We figure that entertainment
would draw gamblers to the casino.

1103
02:22:41,420 --> 02:22:45,180
We hope you'll sign a contract
to appear five times a year.

1104
02:22:48,100 --> 02:22:52,729
Perhaps convince some of your friends
in the movies to do the same.

1105
02:22:53,979 --> 02:22:56,100
We're counting on you.

1106
02:22:58,110 --> 02:23:01,780
Sure, Mike.
I'll do anything for my godfather.

1107
02:23:01,860 --> 02:23:03,149
Good.

1108
02:23:04,780 --> 02:23:09,409
Hey, Mike! Hello, fellows.
Everybody's here. Freddy, Tom.

1109
02:23:09,489 --> 02:23:12,040
-Good to see you.
- How are you, Moe?

1110
02:23:12,159 --> 02:23:17,250
Have everything? Specially prepared
food, the best dancers, and good credit.

1111
02:23:17,329 --> 02:23:20,920
Draw chips for everybody,
so they can play on the house.

1112
02:23:23,590 --> 02:23:26,340
Is my credit good enough
to buy you out?

1113
02:23:28,090 --> 02:23:29,930
Buy me out?

1114
02:23:30,010 --> 02:23:32,600
The casino, the hotel.

1115
02:23:32,680 --> 02:23:35,600
The Corleone family
wants to buy you out.

1116
02:23:35,690 --> 02:23:41,110
The Corleone family wants
to buy me out? No, I buy you out.

1117
02:23:41,190 --> 02:23:44,610
Your casino loses money.
We can do better.

1118
02:23:44,690 --> 02:23:48,569
- You think I'm skimming off the top?
- You're unlucky.

1119
02:23:53,370 --> 02:23:55,790
You Guineas make me laugh.

1120
02:23:55,909 --> 02:24:00,500
I took Freddy in when you had a bad
time, and now you try to push me out!

1121
02:24:01,879 --> 02:24:05,299
You did that
because we bankrolled your casino

1122
02:24:05,379 --> 02:24:10,639
and the Molinari family guaranteed
his safety. Let's talk business.

1123
02:24:10,719 --> 02:24:13,469
Yes. First of all, you're all done.

1124
02:24:13,559 --> 02:24:16,020
You don't have
that kind of muscle anymore.

1125
02:24:16,139 --> 02:24:20,520
The Godfather is sick. You're getting
chased out of New York by the others.

1126
02:24:20,610 --> 02:24:24,530
Do you think you can come to my hotel
and take over?

1127
02:24:24,610 --> 02:24:29,659
I talked to Barzini. I can make a deal
with him and still keep my hotel!

1128
02:24:29,739 --> 02:24:33,239
Is that why you slapped my brother
around in public?

1129
02:24:33,329 --> 02:24:38,159
That was nothing, Mike.
Moe didn't mean nothing by that.

1130
02:24:38,250 --> 02:24:42,459
He flies off the handle sometimes,
but we're good friends.

1131
02:24:42,540 --> 02:24:47,299
I have a business to run.
I've got to kick asses sometimes.

1132
02:24:47,379 --> 02:24:51,260
We had an argument,
so I had to straighten him out.

1133
02:24:51,340 --> 02:24:54,180
You straightened my brother out?

1134
02:24:54,260 --> 02:24:58,729
He was banging cocktail waitresses!
Players couldn't get a drink.

1135
02:24:58,809 --> 02:25:00,770
What's wrong with you?

1136
02:25:05,649 --> 02:25:08,780
I leave for New York tomorrow.
Think about a price.

1137
02:25:09,700 --> 02:25:11,319
Son-of-a-bitch!

1138
02:25:11,409 --> 02:25:16,579
I'm Moe Greene! I made my bones
when you were out with cheerleaders.

1139
02:25:16,659 --> 02:25:19,159
Wait a minute, Moe. I have an idea.

1140
02:25:20,290 --> 02:25:23,840
Tom, you're the consigliere.
Talk to the Don...

1141
02:25:23,959 --> 02:25:29,340
Just a minute. Don is semi-retired and
Mike is in charge of the family business.

1142
02:25:29,420 --> 02:25:32,760
If you have anything to say,
say it to Michael.

1143
02:25:37,639 --> 02:25:42,479
Mike, you don't come to Las Vegas and
talk to a man like Moe Greene like that!

1144
02:25:43,229 --> 02:25:44,440
Fredo...

1145
02:25:45,649 --> 02:25:48,399
You're my older brother, and I love you.

1146
02:25:49,860 --> 02:25:53,870
But don't ever take sides with anyone
against the family again.

1147
02:25:55,370 --> 02:25:56,370
Ever.

1148
02:26:04,500 --> 02:26:08,670
I have to see my father and his people,
so have dinner without me.

1149
02:26:10,420 --> 02:26:15,299
This weekend we'll go out. We'll go to
the city, see a show and have dinner.

1150
02:26:22,690 --> 02:26:25,729
Your sister wants to ask you something.

1151
02:26:25,809 --> 02:26:27,940
- Let her ask.
- She's afraid to.

1152
02:26:28,020 --> 02:26:30,989
They want you to be godfather
to their boy.

1153
02:26:31,069 --> 02:26:32,899
- We'll see.
- Will you?

1154
02:26:32,989 --> 02:26:35,319
Let me think about it. Come on.

1155
02:26:44,209 --> 02:26:47,079
Barzini will move against you first.

1156
02:26:47,170 --> 02:26:51,590
He'll set up a meeting with someone
you absolutely trust.

1157
02:26:51,670 --> 02:26:53,719
Guaranteeing your safety.

1158
02:26:54,969 --> 02:26:58,049
And at that meeting
you'll be assassinated.

1159
02:27:02,770 --> 02:27:05,770
I like to drink wine more than I used to.

1160
02:27:07,190 --> 02:27:10,690
- Anyway, I'm drinking more.
- It's good for you, Pop.

1161
02:27:15,739 --> 02:27:17,239
I don't know.

1162
02:27:19,280 --> 02:27:22,200
Are you happy with your wife
and children?

1163
02:27:23,159 --> 02:27:26,000
- Very happy.
- That's good.

1164
02:27:27,879 --> 02:27:32,760
I hope you don't mind the way I keep
going over this Barzini business.

1165
02:27:32,840 --> 02:27:35,799
- No, not at all.
- It's an old habit.

1166
02:27:37,260 --> 02:27:40,260
I spend my life trying not to be careless.

1167
02:27:41,809 --> 02:27:45,270
Women and children can be careless,
but not men.

1168
02:27:48,600 --> 02:27:50,940
- How's your boy?
- He's good.

1169
02:27:51,069 --> 02:27:53,780
He looks more like you every day.

1170
02:27:56,489 --> 02:28:00,950
He's smarter than I am. He's three
and can read the funny papers.

1171
02:28:03,079 --> 02:28:05,120
Read the funny papers.

1172
02:28:12,340 --> 02:28:17,969
I want you to arrange for a telephone
man to check all in- and out-going calls.

1173
02:28:18,090 --> 02:28:23,389
- I did it already. I took care of that, Pop.
- That's right. I forgot.

1174
02:28:27,440 --> 02:28:29,149
What's the matter?

1175
02:28:29,979 --> 02:28:32,020
What's bothering you?

1176
02:28:35,610 --> 02:28:40,239
I'll handle it. I told you I can handle it,
so I'll handle it.

1177
02:28:53,500 --> 02:28:58,010
I knew that Santino
would have to go through all this.

1178
02:28:58,090 --> 02:28:59,719
And Fredo...

1179
02:29:02,430 --> 02:29:04,469
Fredo was, well...

1180
02:29:06,350 --> 02:29:09,190
But I never wanted this for you.

1181
02:29:11,520 --> 02:29:16,569
I worked my whole life. I don't apologize
for taking care of my family.

1182
02:29:16,649 --> 02:29:20,569
And I refused to be a fool,

1183
02:29:20,659 --> 02:29:24,780
dancing on a string
held by all those big shots.

1184
02:29:26,739 --> 02:29:30,209
I don't apologize. That's my life,
but I thought that,

1185
02:29:31,870 --> 02:29:37,049
that when it was your time, you would
be the one to hold the strings.

1186
02:29:38,840 --> 02:29:44,510
Senator Corleone. Governor Corleone.
Something.

1187
02:29:44,600 --> 02:29:47,600
Another pezzonovante.

1188
02:29:47,680 --> 02:29:49,350
Well...

1189
02:29:52,559 --> 02:29:56,479
Just wasn't enough time, Michael.
Wasn't enough time.

1190
02:29:56,569 --> 02:30:00,069
We'll get there, Pop. We'll get there.

1191
02:30:04,909 --> 02:30:09,370
Now listen, whoever comes to you
with this Barzini meeting,

1192
02:30:09,450 --> 02:30:12,420
he's the traitor. Don't forget that.

1193
02:30:29,389 --> 02:30:31,520
Can I hold it, please?

1194
02:30:46,620 --> 02:30:50,489
- Can I water these?
- Yes, go ahead.

1195
02:30:50,579 --> 02:30:53,370
Over here, over here.

1196
02:30:55,250 --> 02:30:57,750
Be careful. You're spilling it.

1197
02:31:04,129 --> 02:31:05,889
Anthony!

1198
02:31:05,969 --> 02:31:07,639
Come here, come here.

1199
02:31:12,809 --> 02:31:15,479
That's it. We'll put it right there.

1200
02:31:20,690 --> 02:31:23,280
I'll show you something. Come here.

1201
02:31:25,319 --> 02:31:27,200
Stand there.

1202
02:31:30,950 --> 02:31:32,700
Give me an orange!

1203
02:31:51,059 --> 02:31:52,850
That's a new trick.

1204
02:31:53,850 --> 02:31:56,190
You run in there. Run in there.

1205
02:32:09,739 --> 02:32:11,700
Where are you?

1206
02:35:09,379 --> 02:35:11,760
Mike, can I have a minute?

1207
02:35:21,850 --> 02:35:24,309
Barzini wants to arrange a meeting.

1208
02:35:24,389 --> 02:35:27,690
He says we can straighten out
any of our problems.

1209
02:35:28,360 --> 02:35:30,569
- You talked to him?
- Yeah.

1210
02:35:31,899 --> 02:35:35,700
I can arrange security. On my territory.

1211
02:35:38,739 --> 02:35:41,290
- All right?
- All right.

1212
02:35:58,799 --> 02:36:01,760
Do you know
how they're going to come at you?

1213
02:36:04,270 --> 02:36:07,940
They're arranging a meeting
in Brooklyn. Tessio's ground.

1214
02:36:10,110 --> 02:36:11,899
Where I'll be safe.

1215
02:36:24,159 --> 02:36:27,750
I always thought it would be Clemenza,
not Tessio.

1216
02:36:27,829 --> 02:36:31,629
It's the smart move.
Tessio was always smarter.

1217
02:36:33,879 --> 02:36:35,170
But I'm going to wait.

1218
02:36:35,840 --> 02:36:36,840
After the baptism.

1219
02:36:40,719 --> 02:36:44,309
I've decided to be godfather
to Connie's baby.

1220
02:36:44,389 --> 02:36:48,559
And then I'll meet
with Don Barzini and Tattaglia.

1221
02:36:50,149 --> 02:36:53,110
All the heads of the five families.

1222
02:39:14,079 --> 02:39:19,040
Michael, do you believe in God, the
Father, Creator of Heaven and Earth?

1223
02:39:19,129 --> 02:39:20,299
I do.

1224
02:39:20,379 --> 02:39:23,879
Do you believe in Jesus Christ,
His only Son, our Lord?

1225
02:39:23,969 --> 02:39:24,969
I do.

1226
02:39:25,049 --> 02:39:29,100
Do you believe in the Holy Ghost,
the Holy Catholic Church?

1227
02:39:29,180 --> 02:39:30,469
I do.

1228
02:40:36,040 --> 02:40:40,379
Michael Francis Rizzi,
do you renounce Satan?

1229
02:40:46,629 --> 02:40:47,879
I do renounce him.

1230
02:40:57,559 --> 02:40:58,979
And all his works?

1231
02:41:12,870 --> 02:41:13,909
I do renounce them.

1232
02:41:15,659 --> 02:41:16,909
Oh, God!

1233
02:41:19,829 --> 02:41:23,500
- And all his pomps?
- I do renounce them.

1234
02:41:39,270 --> 02:41:43,479
Michael Rizzi, will you be baptized?

1235
02:41:43,559 --> 02:41:44,770
I will.

1236
02:41:51,909 --> 02:41:57,409
Michael Rizzi, go in peace,
and may the Lord be with you. Amen.

1237
02:42:11,629 --> 02:42:13,549
Kay!

1238
02:42:13,639 --> 02:42:15,600
Kiss your godfather.

1239
02:42:40,000 --> 02:42:44,079
Can't go to Vegas.
Something's come up.

1240
02:42:44,170 --> 02:42:45,829
Everybody has to leave without us.

1241
02:42:45,920 --> 02:42:48,879
- Mike, it's our first vacation!
- Connie, please.

1242
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,510
Go back to the house, wait for my call.
It's important.

1243
02:42:53,629 --> 02:42:56,010
I'll only be a couple of days.

1244
02:43:12,280 --> 02:43:14,489
We're on our way to Brooklyn.

1245
02:43:16,659 --> 02:43:20,409
- I hope Mike can get us a good deal.
- I'm sure he will.

1246
02:43:28,209 --> 02:43:33,629
Sal, Tom, the boss says he'll come in a
separate car, so you two go on ahead.

1247
02:43:33,719 --> 02:43:37,260
- That screws up my arrangements.
- That's what he said.

1248
02:43:37,340 --> 02:43:39,510
I can't go either, Sal.

1249
02:43:51,479 --> 02:43:55,399
Tell Mike it was only business.
I always liked him.

1250
02:43:57,069 --> 02:43:59,909
- He understands that.
- Excuse me, Sal.

1251
02:44:05,909 --> 02:44:08,379
Tom, can you get me off the hook?

1252
02:44:09,540 --> 02:44:12,709
- For old times' sake?
- Can't do it, Sally.

1253
02:44:58,129 --> 02:45:00,969
You have to answer for Santino, Carlo.

1254
02:45:05,850 --> 02:45:09,770
- Mike, you got it all wrong.
- You fingered Sonny for Barzini.

1255
02:45:10,809 --> 02:45:14,729
That little farce
you played with my sister.

1256
02:45:14,819 --> 02:45:19,909
- You think that could fool a Corleone?
- I'm innocent. I swear on the kids.

1257
02:45:19,989 --> 02:45:22,700
- Please, don't do this.
- Sit down.

1258
02:45:25,370 --> 02:45:27,659
Don't do this to me, please.

1259
02:45:36,920 --> 02:45:38,670
Barzini is dead.

1260
02:45:40,799 --> 02:45:43,139
So is Philip Tattaglia.

1261
02:45:44,350 --> 02:45:45,850
Moe Greene.

1262
02:45:46,809 --> 02:45:50,600
Strachi. Cuneo.

1263
02:45:52,559 --> 02:45:57,819
Today I settle all family business,
so don't tell me you're innocent, Carlo.

1264
02:45:57,899 --> 02:45:59,690
Admit what you did.

1265
02:46:03,620 --> 02:46:05,280
Get him a drink.

1266
02:46:11,579 --> 02:46:12,870
Come on.

1267
02:46:14,209 --> 02:46:16,629
Don't be afraid, Carlo.

1268
02:46:16,709 --> 02:46:19,590
Do you think
I'd make my sister a widow?

1269
02:46:20,719 --> 02:46:23,430
I'm godfather to your son, Carlo.

1270
02:46:30,350 --> 02:46:32,389
Go ahead, drink, drink.

1271
02:46:37,190 --> 02:46:41,030
No, you're out of the family business.
That's your punishment.

1272
02:46:42,110 --> 02:46:46,069
You're finished.
I'm putting you on a plane to Vegas.

1273
02:46:46,159 --> 02:46:47,780
Tom.

1274
02:46:51,909 --> 02:46:55,500
I want you to stay there. Understand?

1275
02:46:55,579 --> 02:46:58,170
Only don't tell me you're innocent.

1276
02:46:59,420 --> 02:47:03,680
Because it insults my intelligence.
Makes me very angry.

1277
02:47:07,930 --> 02:47:09,969
Who approached you?

1278
02:47:11,270 --> 02:47:13,479
Tattaglia or Barzini?

1279
02:47:21,360 --> 02:47:23,069
It was Barzini.

1280
02:47:27,200 --> 02:47:28,780
Good.

1281
02:47:35,000 --> 02:47:39,040
There's a car waiting outside
to take you to the airport.

1282
02:47:39,129 --> 02:47:42,670
I'll call your wife
and tell her what flight you're on.

1283
02:47:46,969 --> 02:47:49,510
- Mike...
- Get out of my sight.

1284
02:48:15,659 --> 02:48:17,290
Hello, Carlo.

1285
02:49:17,139 --> 02:49:20,270
- I'm trying to tell you...
- Mama, please!

1286
02:49:28,649 --> 02:49:30,739
Michael!

1287
02:49:30,819 --> 02:49:32,819
- What is it?
- Where is he?

1288
02:49:35,239 --> 02:49:40,370
Michael, you lousy bastard!
You killed my husband.

1289
02:49:40,459 --> 02:49:44,540
You waited until Papa died,
so nobody could stop you.

1290
02:49:44,629 --> 02:49:47,709
You blamed him for Sonny.
Everybody did.

1291
02:49:47,799 --> 02:49:53,600
But you never thought about me!
Now what are we going to do?

1292
02:49:53,680 --> 02:49:55,309
Connie.

1293
02:49:57,559 --> 02:50:00,270
Why do you think
he kept Carlo at the Mall?

1294
02:50:00,350 --> 02:50:03,190
He knew he was going to kill him.

1295
02:50:03,270 --> 02:50:08,610
And you stood godfather to our baby.
You lousy cold-hearted bastard!

1296
02:50:08,690 --> 02:50:12,780
Want to know how many men he had
killed with Carlo? Read the papers!

1297
02:50:12,860 --> 02:50:15,620
That's your husband,
that's your husband!

1298
02:50:25,290 --> 02:50:29,510
No! No, no...

1299
02:50:29,590 --> 02:50:32,969
Take her upstairs. Get her a doctor.

1300
02:50:54,110 --> 02:50:55,819
She's hysterical.

1301
02:51:00,370 --> 02:51:02,120
Hysterical.

1302
02:51:04,120 --> 02:51:05,829
Michael, is it true?

1303
02:51:07,840 --> 02:51:11,510
- Don't ask me about my business, Kay.
- Is it true?

1304
02:51:11,590 --> 02:51:14,340
Don't ask me about my business.
Enough!

1305
02:51:34,399 --> 02:51:35,909
All right.

1306
02:51:38,739 --> 02:51:40,489
This one time.

1307
02:51:44,459 --> 02:51:47,790
This one time
I'll let you ask me about my affairs.

1308
02:51:53,879 --> 02:51:55,299
Is it true?

1309
02:51:59,389 --> 02:52:00,889
Is it?

1310
02:52:02,639 --> 02:52:04,020
No.

1311
02:52:17,950 --> 02:52:20,909
I guess we both need a drink. Come on.

1312
02:52:52,190 --> 02:52:53,899
Don Corleone.
